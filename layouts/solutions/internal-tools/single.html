      <p class="text-center mb-4">
        My name is Joe Johnston and I am obsessed with internal tools. Over the last 10 years, I've created over 80 of
        them - one particular tool had over 80,000 users and saved the organization over $3,000,000 per annum. If this
        is your first time learning about building internal software, you've come to the right place. This is NOT your
        average "Internal tools in 2022" post. This is a continually evolving environment to learn about the finer
        details of building internal tools, and how they can help you accelerate digital transformation and supercharge
        your organizational efficiency.

        <p>Internal tools have been around since the early days of software development. They're the unsung heroes that
          power the majority of businesses that exist today. And they're growing in popularity.

        <br />
        <p>
          Software is eating the world, and digital transformation is at the top of every CIO/CTOs agenda. $120 billion
          was spent last year on internal software development. This figure will continue to increase as we gather more
          data, become more distributed, and industries become more competitive.

        <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4">Examples of internal tools</h3>
        <p>
          Below are examples of internal tools used within companies
          and a general list of popular internal tools we've seen users build
          within Budibase.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-6 mb-4">Companies that use internal tools</h4>
        <img class="u-avatar mt-4" src="/img/internal-tools/google-logo.png" alt="Google logo" loading="lazy">
        <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Google internal tools</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Google are infamous for their internal tools. I have spoken with a few
          product managers at Google and I'm under good authority they have over 500
          internal tools in the wild. Some of those tools have hit the
          headlines, including the two below:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Google's internal browser -</b> Google developed an internal browser tool that monitors meeting requests
          made by employees. This has upset a number of employees, who have spoken out about the new internal tool. A
          Google representative denied the tool was for 'spying', saying the company developed the extension in response
          to an uptick in spam involving calendar entries. Basically, the tool alerts employees when they attempt to
          auto-add a meeting to the calendars of large numbers of people. The extension does not prevent users from
          creating such meetings and doesn't collect personal information.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          <b>Google's Borgmon (now Monarch) - </b> As you can imagine, Google
          has a collossal task on its hands monitoring its computer systems. The
          teams behind tools such as YouTube, Gmail, etc, need to monitor a
          continually growing and changing collection of heterogeneous entities
          including visual machines, devices, containers. The total of entities
          stretches into the billions and, to make matters more difficult, are
          distributed around the globe. So, Google built Borgmon. Any Google
          engineer, between 2004 and 2014, will have fond memories of Borgmon -
          it was a beast and involved a steep learning curve - but it worked, to
          a degree. Google have since replaced Borgmon with Monarch, which can
          manage trillions of time series and is essential to the smooth running
          of the Google engineering empire.
        </p>

          alt="Google internal tool ui"
        />
        <img class="u-avatar mt-9" src="/img/internal-tools/airbnb-logo.webp" alt="evolving_google_identity_inline_002" loading="lazy">
        <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Airbnb</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          You cannot hit IPO without experimentation. Airbnb understood this
          from the very beginning. They state:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "At Airbnb we are always trying to learn more about our users and
          improve their experience on the site. Much of that learning and
          improvement comes through the deployment of controlled experiments."
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          To run and manage their many experiences, Airbnb created an internal
          tool. The tool did all the heavy analytical lifting automatically,
          whilst limiting bias when setting up an experiment. When designing the
          tool in 2014, simplicity was the primary goal, and it shows:
        </p>
        <img
          src="/img/internal-tools/airbnb.png"
          class="img-fluid mt-4"
          alt="airbnb internal tool ui"
        />
        <img class="u-avatar mt-9" src="/img/internal-tools/stripe-logo.png" alt="Stripe icon" loading="lazy">
        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Stripe</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          On a call with David Singleton, CTO at Stripe, we asked him if they
          preferred to "build vs buy". His answer was
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "Build, depending on the scale of the task at hand. For example, we
          use Github, because the engineering effort to build a tool like Github
          is not worth our time and engineering effort."
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          This is a quintessential answer. Below is a design of one of Stripe's many internal tools, called Home. Home
          is Stripe's employee resources portal. It provides directories for employees and teams, as well as
          company-wide resources like calendars, events, and announcements.
        </p>
        <img src="/img/internal-tools/stripe.png" class="img-fluid mt-4 mb-4" alt="airbnb internal tool ui" />
        <p class="mt-2">
          Credit to Stripe, their design always seems to strike the perfect balance between beauty, and communicating
          'we're an incredible technical company'. It's great to see a company apply the same effort to design and build
          their internal tools, as they do their external tools.

        <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4">6 Popular internal tools</h3>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">CRM</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          A CRM (customer relationship manager) helps sales/marketing teams
          manage their prospects/clients. There are many off-the-shelf CRMs including
          Salesforce, Pipedrive, etc, but many organizations build their own
          CRMs due to the unique nature of their sales process. I worked in the
          defence industry and we used Microsoft Dynamics. It was a great
          platform, but due to the uniqueness of our sales process, the sales
          team hated it. It was not fit for purpose. We spent north of $40,000
          customizing the tool to fit our needs, but still, it did not suffice.
          So we built our own and the team loved it.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Dashboard / Database GUI</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Data is eating the world. As more organizations and processes move online,
          the more data we obtain. Collecting data is generally the easy part, it's the interpretation of this data
          which is hard. In many cases, data is distributed across multiple data sources, making it a little tricky to
          compile and analyse. Many companies build internal tools / dashboards to help display this data in a way which
          is easily interpreted. This is one of the primary reasons why Budibase supports many different data sources
          including Mongo DB, Couch DB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, CSV, Dyanmo DB, and more.
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Admin Panel</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Many SaaS / eCommerce platforms require an admin panel to manage
          backend operations. They allow you to approve user access, manipulate
          data, and track transactions. Admin panels often have a dashboard
          element built-in to save time exporting data to another platform. Like
          all items on this list, the decision to build an admin panel is
          usually down to a custom requirement which is not available of-the-shelf.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Approval Apps</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Generally speaking, the larger the organization the more layers of management it has. A popular process within organizations, especially enterprise, is the approval process. This category can involve many, highly specific approval processes, from booking holidays to signing-off on a sale. When building this type of internal tool, understanding the different types of users and their hierarchy, is crucial. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Inventory apps</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Inventory can take many forms; from rockets to Tamagotchis. Managing this inventory involves a robust
          database, an interactive UI, and automations to accelerate the processes involved with managing shipments,
          orders, and deliveries. Often, a control dashboard where a manager can gain a snapshot of operations, is also
          required. On top of this, internal development teams need to stay on top of how inventory apps feed into to
          related tools, processes, and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">IT Support ticketing tool</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          There are many departments within a business which require software to
          do their job more effectively - Sales have the CRM, HR have the HR
          platform, and IT Support have the ticketing system (among others). The
          core function of an IT ticketing system is to manage incoming support
          requests from general employees. As you can imagine, the life of an IT
          support technician can get stressful. Hardware/software have changed
          our lives, but they are complicated beasts and come with many
          problems. Combine that, with stressful/over-worked employees, and you
          get tickets of fury coming at you from all angles, 24 hours a day.
          This is exactly why a good ticketing system is essential. It helps IT
          Support plan, triage, disseminate, and inform - allowing them to do
          their job with an impressive level of calmness and efficiency.

        Internal tools are generally built by developers, but if we're honest, they're not the projects developers like
        to work on. So if internal tools are becoming more popular, isn’t this a developer’s worst nightmare? Not
        exactly.

        That is, with new technology, the way developers build internal tools is changing too. These advancements have
        reduced the learning curve, abstracted a lot of the more difficult technical parts, and made it super quick to
        build internal tools. This has led to a new wave of internal tool developers. Below we will explore the types of
        users building internal tools with Budibase.

      <hr class="p-2" />

      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">The illustrious internal tools developer</h3>
      <p>
        The illustrious internal tools developer is often the unsung hero in
        many cases. They are building mission critical software, but often don't
        get the recognition they deserve. Over 40% of Budibase's users are
        developers of some type. Their general reasons for using a low code platform, include speed, ease of design, and simplicity.
      </p>
      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">The highly versatile product manager</h3>
      <p>
        Product managers are an emerging role which use to be reserved for
        larger organisations. We are beginning to see more product managers
        working within SMEs which is testament to the importance of this role.
        The beauty of a product manager is they are 100% committed to a
        product; providing direction, ownership, and insights at all times. In a
        lot of cases, they're both technical and business focused - which is an
        incredibly powerful mix. Through conversations with PMs, one overarching
        theme has stood out for us - Product Managers fully understand the
        business value of these tools. Just under 20% of Budibase's signups are
        product managers, and growing!
      </p>
      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">The incredibly helpful IT Manager</h3>
      <p>
        Over 15% of Budibase users are IT managers. They generally belong to
        manufacturing / construction / logistics industries and work within a small
        team. Due to the nature of their business, we've found they are often
        building multiple internal tools, from inventory to CRMs, as their role
        primarily revolves around supporting the organizations internal
        technology and business operations. Around 15% of Budibase signups are IT managers or 'IT professionals'.
      </p>
      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">Additional Emerging roles</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, as technology changes, so too do the job roles organizations must fill to manage new business
        processes. Here are too specific emerging specialisms that we've noticed growing in popularity among Budibase
        sign-ups over the last few years.

      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Data PM</h4>
      <p>
        Due to the increasing importance and collection of data, we've noticed
        Data PMs signing up to Budibase. On inspection, their responsibilities
        lie within creating interfaces to make sense of the large amounts of
        data collected within their platforms. They then analyse this data to
        inform business direction. It's very much a data analyst / product
        manager hybrid - which seems like a role which could benefit almost
        every organization on earth.
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Product Ops</h4>
      <p>
        Basically, a product manager whose sole focus is on internal operations. We’ve noticed this role within larger
        organizations, and the low-code platform/internal tool builder seems to be their weapon of choice. We are
        watching this role very carefully, as it seems like it could grow in popularity as internal operations increase
        (due to digital transformation and the increasingly distributed workforce). Specifically, product ops teams love
        low-code, since it allows them to push out effective solutions to process-specific problems, as quickly as
        possible.

              Building internal tools is different from building
              customer-facing tools. When building internal tools, you have
              greater access to the end-user. Quite often, when using an
              internal tool builder, the build process is a collaboration
              between builder and user. This is a beautiful, powerful experience
              and often results in an outstanding internal tool.

          There are primarily two ways to build an internal tool; completely
          with code, or with an internal tool builder.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-2">
          Both options have their pros and cons; code is more flexible; internal
          tool builders are faster, easier, and more cost effective.

          What is the Internal Development Methodology (IDM)
        </h3>
        <div class="p-4 mb-6 rounded-sm">
          <p class="lead font-weight-semi-bold blockquote">
            The internal development methodology is the method of building
            internal tools to automate processes, equip your workforce, and grow
            your organization. It’s about building tools to empower your employees
            to do more, and do it faster.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Why? Because when your employees succeed, you succeed.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">introducing the IDM flywheel</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The Internal Development Methodology can be applied in four ways:
        </p>
        <img src="/img/internal-tools/idm.png" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4" alt="Why build internal tools" />
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Collaborate</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          To build an internal tool users love, you need the
          builder and the AU (admin user) to collaborate. Depending on the size
          of the organization, the team involved with building the internal tool may
          involve a product manager (if you can involve a product manager, do!).
          Collaboration provides motivation and encourages creativity; whilst
          reducing errors and upsets. During this phase, planning is completed,
          the project is scoped, and the architecture decided. In cases where
          the admin user is also the builder, it is still important to plan,
          scope, and architect.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Build</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Within Budibase, there are three phases to the build process; data, design, and automation. During the data
          phase, you structure your data, and add it to the builder. During the design phase, you build your application
          with pre-made components and screens. You can then pull in data to your components, and query them with
          incredible ease. And during the automation phase, you will automate certain processes such as email,
          notifications, and more. We feel the data, design, and automation pathway is the easiest to learn and the most
          natural for devs. Other internal tool builders may differ.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Test</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Testing should be completed across the relevant browsers and devices.
          It is a good idea, to test with a user who has not been exposed to the
          tool during development. It is up to the admin user to sign the
          internal tool off.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Deploy</h4>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Once the tool is signed off, you are ready to deploy it to production.
          The admin user will record any bugs experienced and collaborate with
          the builder to fix them - in some cases, due to their familiarity,
          they should be able to fix some issues.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          We've experimented with this methodology for several years now and every time it has resulted in superior
          internal tools, happier users, and advocates! And it's these advocates who promote this methodology, which
          results in more internal tools, happier employees, and faster, more productive businesses. This is how your
          organization builds momentum, and this is why the internal development methodology serves as a strong
          foundation for your flywheel.
        </p>
        <hr class="p-2" />

        <h3 class="space-2-top mb-4">
          How does the methodology affect the user (employee)
        </h3>
        <img src="/img/internal-tools/idm-user.png" class="img-fluid mt-4 mb-6"
          alt="Internal development methodology" />
        <p class="mb-4">
         As we previously mentioned, the internal development methodology can have a positive effect on your employees, equipping them to do more, faster. What's great about the methodology, is it also converts your employees into advocates, which spreads motivation.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Below outlines how IDM transforms a user into an advocate.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Collaborate (user)</b> - The AU (employee) is fully involved from
          the very beginning. They lead the planning, participate in scoping,
          and assist with architecture. In a sense, they are the product
          manager. They are the ones who fully understand the problem afterall.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Build (co-creator)</b> - The AU co-creates the internal tool,
          providing UI/UX feedback along the way. Co-creation is incredibly
          powerful, and made possible with internal tool builders such as Budibase.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Test (owner)</b> - The AU is also the tester. They understand the
          tool, they understand how it should perform, and what the common user
          will expect from it. They have the final say on whether or not the
          product is the ready for deployment - at this stage, they are the
          owner.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Deploy (advocate)</b> - The AU, due to their heavy involvement, is
          the internal tool's advocate and first line of support for their team. They
          are the owner, they are the creator, they will promote the product to
          their team and gather feedback which then kickstarts the flywheel
          again. In some cases, they can make changes without the need of the
          internal tool developer.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Once the user becomes an advocate they sell the internal tool to their
          colleagues. Their colleagues, the new users, experience the platform
          and immediately begin considering how they can create internal tools
          to improve their jobs and provide the company with more value. The
          wheel keeps spinning, and a faster, happier workforce grows.

        <h3 class="space-2-top mb-4">
          Important considerations when building internal tools
        </h3>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Collaboration is key</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Better collaboration results in better internal apps. It also results
          in happier users, advocates, less bugs, less support, and less
          maintenance. Trust me, it's worth it!
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Infrastructure</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          When deploying your apps, it's important to understand where in the
          world your users will reside as this will impact perf. If you are in a
          highly secured environment, it's generally better to self-host your
          apps in the comfort of your own infrastructure.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Security</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Do you remember in the summer of 2020, when President Barack Obama,
          Joe Biden, and Elon Musk's Twitter accounts were hacked? Well, the
          hackers managed to compromise one of their internal tools and get
          access to their accounts. Please take security serious. Below is a picture of the
          internal tool:
        </p>
        <img
          src="/img/internal-tools/twitter.webp"
          class="img-fluid mt-4"
          alt="Twitter internal tool ui"
        />
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Extensibility</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          It's important to scope the internal tool to understand any areas
          that might require additional development outside of the internal
          tool builder. If there is development, please make sure your tool of
          choice is extensible and allows you to build on top of it - being able
          to see the codebase is a huge advantage here. This will also reduce
          technical debt.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Gather feedback and measure success</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          At Budibase, we like to include an NPS feedback popover in our apps. It
          asks the user to rate, from 1 to 10, how likely they are to rate this
          internal tool to a colleague. Underneath the scale, we include a
          comment box. This helps us understand the general feeling towards our
          app. Understanding feedback helps us build better tools.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Design matters</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          When building an internal tool, it is advised to think of your users
          like you would an external application. Uber have many internal tools,
          and Kamal Boparai, Engineering Manager, IT Eng Compliance and Legal
          (Engineering) Team puts it nicely in the statement below:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "The IT Eng team is very focused on our end users (Uber employees) and
          their experiences. We always put our end users first; from there, we
          can help external end users (Uber’s partners and customers) virtually.
          Even more importantly, we keep the Uber network functioning properly
          and create the infrastructure that supports Uber employees. Basically,
          IT Eng is responsible for everything that happens in the background to
          keep Uber running smoothly."<br />Kamal Boparai,Engineering Manager

        <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Internal tools software and builders across your organization</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">More and more businesses have dedicated people, whose full-time job is building internal tools.
          Still, as we’ve seen, a whole bunch of different professionals can find themselves working on internal
          software, at least from time to time.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">So does your choice of platform impact their success? Or, to put it another way, what can you do
          to empower your team to create the right tools, the right way?</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Besides determining the cost of internal tools, different builder platforms will offer very
          different experiences for each class of user.
        <p>Here’s what each one needs to thrive.</p>
        <h5 class="space-1-top mb-2">Developers’ time is money</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">The faster your internal developers can build and deploy new tools, the better. As long as
          they’re not compromising on quality, that is. This is doubly true if you have developers working on internal
          projects, even though this isn’t their main responsibility.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"> The crux of this is that your developers are skilled professionals, with some of the highest
          labor costs in your entire organization. Clearly then, you want to choose the tool that’s going to offer the
          best developer experiences, the most flexibility, and the lowest lead times.</p>

        <h5 class="space-1-top mb-2">Product managers might have the vision</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">But they still aren’t developers.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The thing is, your product team knows your processes inside and out. They’re probably more aware than anyone
          of the need to drive efficiency too. The missing step is giving them the tools they need to put this into
          practice.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">If you want to empower your non-technical people to build internal tools, you need a platform that offers
          high levels of functionality, with intuitive, user-friendly experiences. That way, anyone can be a developer,
          not just your developers.</p>

        <h5 class="space-1-top">IT teams have a lot on their minds</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">IT managers have to juggle more concerns than just about anyone else in your organization. On the one hand,
          their job is to make sure everybody else has the tools they need. On the other, they need to make sure that
          these tools are secure, compliant, and cost-effective.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"> You can see how this would go out the window if different teams built their own tools with no oversight.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The key, therefore, is furnishing your team with the tools they need to build effective internal software,
          without undermining your broader IT strategy.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We’ll return to how Budibase can help you balance all of these concerns a little later.</p>

            2020 was a disastrous year for people around the world, and for many
            businesses too. The events in 2020 and 2021 will inevitably lead to
            organizations looking inwards to find answers. Building internal
            tools with internal tool builders can play a huge role in helping
            an organization cut costs whilst improving output.

          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Increased Productivity</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Internal tools have increased productivity across the board for the
            majority of industries, but the scale in which they're rolled out
            can make a huge difference.
            <a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/Optimize/pr_roi.html"
              >A study from 2003</a
            >
            showed that while Wal-Mart and Kmart both invested in IT, Wal-Mart
            did a better job of changing the rest of their business to work with
            the technology, and consequently saw “higher levels of productivity
            and market value”.
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Cost effective</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Of-the-shelf software, especially enterprise software, costs a
            crippling amount. When building internal tools with an internal tool
            builder, you can save 10x the cost of off-the-shelf software - sometimes a lot more! You
            can save even more if you self-host your tools on
            your own infrastructure. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Improved Security</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            If you are self-hosting on your own infrastructure, and implementing your own Auth system, in a lot of
            cases the security will be better.
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">More control</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            When building your own tools, you have the power to build them
            exactly how you want them. As previously mentioned, you are building
            a solution around your specific problem. One of the common reasons
            users come to Budibase to build custom software is because a part of
            their business is so unique that no off-the-shelf software can solve
            their problem how they'd like them to.

          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Happier employees (advocates)</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Providing your employees with the right tools to do their jobs is
            incredible fulfilling for employees. As I am sure you are aware, a
            common scenario in organizations is a disgruntled employee battling
            with an unfit tool, or using a particular tool to solve a problem
            the tool was not designed for. (We'll chat about Microsoft Office
            soon).
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">The technology is here</h3>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Previously it would take an internal software developer/development
            team, on average, 4 weeks to 6 months to build an internal tool.
            With modern internal tool builders, such as
            <a href="/">Budibase</a>, internal software developers can build and
            ship these same tools in days.

            Common alternatives to building Internal Tools
          </h3>
          <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Sure, I've got Microsoft Office</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Microsoft Office is the workplace swiss army knife. We're grew up
            using it, loving it, and inevitably hating it. But, please don't see
            this as slander. It's an incredible platform, with incredible tools
            which solve common problems. In fact, a highly product Excel user is
            basically an engineer with a different title; building internal
            software (albeit in a highly restrictive environment). The problem is how we
            overuse these tools to solve problems which they are not suitable
            for. Here's an example of how nearly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54423988">16,000 people who tested
              positive for the coronavirus disappeared from records due to an

            The emergence of internal tool builders has reduced the barriers and
            resolved many of the concerns around building internal tools. If
            organizations were more willing to build their own internal tools,
            specific to their needs, they would experience huge productivity
            gains, an increase in employee satisfaction, and potential market
            growth. With
            digital transformation now a priority for most businesses, there has

            <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Building internal tools with Budibase in 6 steps</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">As we said earlier, most of our users are professional developers. That is, they know how to code, but
              they choose our platform because it makes their lives easier, faster, and more cost-effective.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In fact, we make the development process so smooth and intuitive, that Budibase is loved by developers
              and non-technical professionals alike.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Let’s take a real-world example to show off just how simple internal development can be.</p>

            <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">1. Scope out your internal tool</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">As with any project, the first thing we need to do is define our requirements. As we’ve seen
              already, internal-facing apps can vary quite a lot in terms of complexity. So, sometimes these might be
              aimed at a single, discrete task. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Other times, they might be used to manage a whole raft of tasks within a wider department or
              team.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">For simplicity’s sake, let’s focus on the former. You can then scale up the same approach
              for more complex tools.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Obviously, our first task is deciding what we want our tool to do. The best jumping-off
              point here is figuring out which processes, tasks, and user actions we want to replace or manage. In other
              words, how our users will interact with the tool and what will happen in response.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Let’s say we’re building an internal vacation approval platform. We’d probably come up with
              a list of requirements along the lines of:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Employees can request paid leave, depending on their remaining allowance.</li>
              <li>Relevant line managers are notified when a new request is submitted.</li>
              <li>Line managers can approve or deny requests, based on staffing levels and the information provided.
              </li>
              <li>The original employee is notified when the line manager makes a decision.</li>
              <li>Approved requests are added automatically to the team calendar.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mb-4">This might seem simple enough, but don’t be afraid to read over it a couple of times so
              you’re fully familiar with it. We’ll be using the same example for the rest of this article, to see how
              much time and effort you’ll save using Budibase vs hard coding a similar tool.
            </p>

            <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">2. Build a data model</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Once we understand our requirements, we need to think about the data we’ll leverage to put
              them into practice. Basically, what kinds of objects our tool will deal with and what we need to know
              about each one.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">This is what’s known as a data model. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">To hard code this, we’d need to create a database from scratch, or at least connect to an
              existing one if we’re lucky enough to have something like this available.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">With Budibase we have a couple of different options. We could still connect to existing
              data. Alternatively, we have the option of using BudibaseDB, to quickly create an effective data model, on
              the fly.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Let’s think about what data we’ll need, and then you can make your own decision.
              Essentially, our tool will store information on three separate but related entities: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Employees</li>
              <li>Line-managers</li>
              <li>Requests</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">Each employee is related to one line manager, but each line manager is related to many
              employees. Each request is related to one employee and one line manager, but both can be related to many
              requests.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The specific attributes you need to store on each will depend on your existing processes,
              the size of your organization, and the complexity of its structure.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">For employees and line managers, we’ll definitely need to know their personal information,
              holiday allowance, job role, and any other relevant details for vacation decisions. For requests, we might
              only need to know the relevant dates and maybe optional comments.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We can achieve this in just a few seconds with Budibase DB, and then edit it on the fly
              afterward. Or, we could even import a CSV to get started even faster. Alternatively, we still have the
              option of connecting to an external database, if we prefer.</p>

            <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">3. Create stunning interfaces</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">With our data model in place, we can think about the interfaces we’ll need to let users
              interact with stored information. Since we’re dealing with a relatively tight set of requirements, we
              won’t need many screens to make our app a reality. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Essentially, we’ll need:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One form for employees to make requests.</li>
              <li>A second form for line managers to respond and add comments. </li>
              <li>A home screen for employees and line managers to view and search existing requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">If we were feeling fancy, we could also add a third form for employees to edit or delete
              their previous requests, but that goes a little bit beyond the requirements we set out earlier, so we
              won’t worry about it today.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">You might not believe how easy Budibase makes this step.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">You literally don’t have to design a single thing, if you don’t want to. We offer
              auto-generated CRUD screens, so you can achieve functional interfaces to manage connected data sources at
              the press of a button.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Of course, you’ll probably still want to tinker around the edges and perfect your internal
              tool UIs.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Even then, we offer an incredible degree of customization and flexibility, while still
              keeping custom code optional. Use our intuitive builder to add, move, delete, and configure any of our
              library of built-in app components.
            </p>

            <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">4. Build business processes</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Next, we can think about the processes that will link our interfaces to our data. Again,
              Budibase makes this a breeze. For simple business processes, you don’t need to do much at all.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">For example, our autogenerate forms are already fully functional, so there’s no need to
              write out queries manually.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">For more specific tasks, you have a couple of options for creating custom business processes
              in Budibase.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you opt to connect to external data, you have full control to build your own queries,
              transformation rules, bindable values, and more.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">We also offer a dedicated automation builder, drawing on a full library of built-in
              functions and rules, or third-party integrations. Use user actions, system events, data conditions,
              external signals, and more to trigger your custom automations.
            </p>

            <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">5. Assign access roles</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">We also need to think about how different users will interact with our internal tools. In
              fact, it’s very rare to find internal software where all users perform the exact same actions. Rather,
              it’s normal for there to be a hierarchy of roles and responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Our vacation request example makes this incredibly plain.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Remember, we have three entities, two of which are employees and line managers.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Each of these corresponds to a different type of user, who needs a different level of
              access.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">In Budibase, we can grant or limit access to different resources for each defined role in a
              couple of different ways. First, we can configure a minimum access level required for each individual
              screen.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Alternatively, we can use conditionality rules to define access rules for individual
              components within a screen.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Finally, we can limit read and write access to individual tables within BudibaseDB, to
              control permissions across the board.
            </p>

            <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">6. Deploy your internal software</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Finally, we can deploy our internal tool for managing vacation requests. As ever, Budibase
              offers a couple of different options here:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deploying with Budibase Cloud.</li>
              <li>Self-hosting internal tools on your own infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">We don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to internal development.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Instead, we offer our developers and users the flexibility they need to create the perfect
              solutions for their specific needs. So, if you need the convenience of one-click cloud deployment, we’ve
              got you covered.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Or, if you need extra customization, security, configuration, and control, self-hosted
              Budibase tools are the perfect solution. Deploy to your own infrastructure with Kubernetes, Docker, Docker
              Compose, Digital Ocean, and more.</p>

              tools?</p>
            <p class="mb-4">After all, we obviously have a vested interest, don’t we?</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Well, yes and no. On the one hand, we clearly want you to see things our way. On the other,
              we’re pretty confident that once you’ve tried Budibase, you won’t want to go back to slow-coding your
              internal software. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">To help you get started, we’ve created over 50 fully deployable, free app templates, using
              our own platform.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Let’s take a look at some of our favorite internal tools, which you can use or customize
              today.</p>

            <h4 class="space-2-top mb-2">Incident reporting</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Check out our <a href="https://budibase.com/forms/templates/it-incident-report-template/">IT
                incident report form</a>, for a simple, customizable tool to register and record all kinds of hardware,
              software, and security issues.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">This is a deceptively simple internal tool, but it could save you untold amounts of time,
              hassle, and money. The faster your team reports incidents, the better positioned you are to limit damage,
              learn lessons, and prevent reoccurrence. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Unfortunately, many employees won’t bother to do this, unless you make it as easy as
              possible. So, having an intuitive, fast, and easy-to-access incident report tool can literally be a
              lifesaver.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Or, in the case of security breaches, a reputation saver.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Our tool offers two separate access roles and experiences, for on-the-ground employees and
              IT team members respectively. It’s the perfect one-stop-shop for reporting and responding to all manner of
              incidents internally.
            </p>

            <h4 class="space-2-top mb-2">Invoice approvals </h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Expense management is one of the most ubiquitous business processes around. Basically, every
              department in every business does this, at least to some extent. Our <a
                href="https://budibase.com/approval-apps/templates/invoice-approval-software/">invoice approval software
                template</a> is your best friend here. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">This is the perfect example of a simple internal tool that could save you heaps of money in
              redundant admin tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Say goodbye to lengthy calls, email chains, and follow-up questions with the finance
              department. Our template is designed to eliminate manual interactions entirely. Employees can submit
              invoices at their convenience.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">These can then be approved or declined by the responsible team.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">You can even add extra power to our template by creating your own automated approval rules.
              For instance, by instantly approving any invoices that fall below a certain threshold, or come from
              particular teams.
            </p>

            <h4 class="space-2-top mb-2">Employee timesheets</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">In many businesses, time logs are at the center of a whole host of internal operations
              processes. So, gathering accurate, detailed records of how your team is spending their day is central to
              profitability.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">We’ve built our <a
                href="https://budibase.com/professional-services/templates/employee-timesheet-template/">employee
                timesheet template</a> to achieve exactly that.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Our template offers a seamless experience for employees to submit multiple timesheets, in
              one sitting, making it the perfect way to record accurate, reliable data to inform a huge range of
              processes.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Use our template to simplify job costing, HR processes, finances, project management,
              payroll, invoicing, and more.

            <h4 class="space-2-top mb-2">Maintenance requests</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">We’ve all worked in offices where things break and never get fixed. At best, this can be
              annoying. At worst, it compromises your employees’ morale, job satisfaction, productivity, and even their
              safety.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">You can set hourly rates for all different kinds of project functions in the back-end data
              layer. Then, users can provide time estimates for each stage of the project to create a robust, itemized
              budget.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">We’ve built our <a
