            <summary class="lead">Why should I use Budibase as my form builder?</summary>
            <p class="mb-2 mx-3">There primarily three reasons to choose Budibase over other form builders:
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-semi-bold">Security</span> - Unlike other platforms, Budibase priortises security. With Budibase, you can build forms on top of your favorite/trusted database and self-host your forms/data within your own infrastructure. This ensures you're always in control of the data. 
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-semi-bold">Flexibility</span> - With Budibase, you have creative freedom to design forms you're proud of. Budibase's design experience is more flexible than other platforms allowing you to build complex forms with multiple columns, sections, and component types.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-semi-bold">Long-term viability</span> - Budibase is a form builder, and more. It's a low-code platform with a focus on making work flow. With Budibase, you can build forms, approval apps, portals, and much more. So, from a long-term viability perspective, Budibase is far superior than other form builders. It's also open-source!
