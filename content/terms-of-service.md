# 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 This page sets out the general customer terms (General Terms) which apply to BB’s software as a Service (as defined below) programmes and associated Services which BB (as defined below) licences or provides to any Customer (as defined below), unless Customer has entered into a separate written contract with BB signed by both parties in respect of the Services.  

1.2 The parties’ agreement for the licensing, use and provision of the Services is made up of (i) these General Terms; (ii) the Proposal; and (iii) any other written document either issued by BB (and expressly referring to and incorporating itself into the agreement) or any amendments or supplements to the agreement signed and agreed in writing between the parties. Together the above documents shall constitute and be known as the Agreement and apply to the contract between the parties to the exclusion of any other terms that Customer may seek to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing. For the avoidance of doubt, whilst the Services and Software may be marketed in online marketplaces which purport to allow customers to check out electronically, no agreement for the Services or Software shall be binding other than as signed or otherwise agreed in writing by an authorised representative of BB.

1.3 When construing the meaning of the Agreement, the documents listed in clause 1.2 shall be interpreted in a reverse order of priority in the event of any inconsistency or conflict, with documents appearing later in the list taking priority over documents appearing earlier in the list. 

1.4 Any order placed by Customer (including orders for additional Chargeable Features) shall only be deemed to be accepted upon BB’s signature of the Proposal, or acceptance of the relevant Checkout Process submission by the Customer via the BB platform (which acceptance shall be confirmed by email or notification via the platform) at which point and on which date the Agreement shall come into existence.

1.5 These General Terms are published on BB’s website. Customer should print or save a copy of these General Terms for its records.  BB may amend these General Terms from time to time as set out in clause 17.15. Every time Customer completes the Checkout Process or signs or agree a new Proposal with BB it should check these General Terms to ensure that it understands the terms which will apply to the Agreement at that time. This version one of these General Terms was most recently updated on 6th October 2021 Historic versions, where applicable, may be obtained by contacting us. 

1.6 If BB issues a written Proposal (which it will not normally do, most / all of the Services being self-service via an applicable Checkout Process) it shall be valid for a period of 30 days (or such longer period specified on the Proposal) from the date of issue, if not agreed by Customer, at which point the offer outlined in the Proposal shall lapse.

In particular, where Customer is or purports to represent an organisation or entity, Customer (including the person entering into the Agreement on Customer’s behalf in their individual capacity) warrants and represents that it or they is/are entitled to act in this capacity and to bind such organisation or entity (which shall be correctly specified as Customer in the relevant Proposal), and perform all actions taken by Customer or its Authorised Users via the Subscription Services, including uploading any Customer Data to Customer’s account (including making it available to other Authorised Users, or publicly available to third parties). 

3.2 Customer acknowledges that it shall have sole responsibility for supervision and observation of the actions of its Authorised Users, and for setting any data access restrictions or administrative rights for Authorised Users in terms of the Subscription Services.

3.3 Subject to payment and the other restrictions set out in the Agreement, BB hereby grants to Customer, subject to the Licence Restrictions and subject to compliance with the EULA applicable to each Authorised User, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non sub-licensable right to permit the its Authorised Users to use the free of charge Subscription Services (as well as any Chargeable Features Customer has subscribed and paid for the relevant period subscribed for) during the Subscription Term, solely for the Purpose. The rights provided under this clause are granted to Customer only, and not to any subsidiary, affiliated or holding company of Customer. 

3.4 If agreed during the Checkout Process or as part of a Proposal, BB may permit Customer to issue a potentially indefinite number of User Licences to Authorised Users by creating Authorised Users through its super admin account for access to the Subscription Services (a seat limitation may also be specified). However, if BB does the former Customer must act reasonably and in good faith in exercising its rights, and all Authorised Users must meet the proper criteria and definition for Authorised Users under the Agreement, including that they must be using the Subscription Services for relevant and legitimate business purposes associated with Customer’s (or if relevant any Subscribing Organisations’). Customer must not invite Authorised Users who do not meet these requirements. BB shall exercise its discretion in assessing whether Customer has adhered to these restrictions. Customer should also note that each Authorised User it adds to its Organisation will increase its potential data usage. Customer will be responsible for paying for excess use that exceeds any limitations in the Proposal or which might otherwise apply from time to time. 

3.5 Customer acknowledges and agrees that its entitlement to access and use any applicable Free Services offered as part of the Subscription Services constitutes good and sufficient consideration and in return it is willing to adhere to the terms of the Agreement. 

3.6 In relation to the Authorised Users, Customer undertakes that: (a) it shall be responsible for compliance by Authorised Users (who must be aged 18 or over the legally required age in the country in which they live and to whose laws they are subject to use the Subscription Services) with the relevant terms of the Agreement and the terms of the EULA, and for compliance by any Subscribing Organisations with the applicable terms of the Agreement, and that the restrictions on Customer set out within the Agreement shall, unless the context requires otherwise, equally apply to any such persons; (b) the number of Authorised Users shall not exceed any limits specified in the Checkout Process or purchased by Customer from time to time; (c) it will not allow or suffer any one Authorised User’s account to be used by more than one individual Authorised User unless it has been reassigned in its entirety to another individual Authorised User, in which case the prior Authorised User shall no longer have any right to access or use the Subscription Services and/or their documentation; (d) each Authorised User shall keep a secure and confidential password for their use of the Subscription Services; (e) it shall permit BB to audit its use of the Subscription Services and provide all such full, prompt accurate and complete information and assistance as BB may require in order to establish the name, role, functions and (if applicable) password of each Authorised User (so as to ensure that such Authorised User satisfies the relevant requirements of the Agreement); (f) if any of the audits referred to above reveals that Customer has underpaid Subscription Charges to BB, then without prejudice to any other right to which it may be entitled, Customer shall pay to BB an amount equal to such underpayment (as calculated by BB in its reasonable discretion based on the then current pricing that would apply to a new customer accessing the Subscription Services, which amount Customer accepts as being reasonable) within 10 Business Days of the date of the relevant audit; and (h) if any of the audits referred to above reveal that any password has been provided to any individual who is not an Authorised User, then without prejudice to BB’s other rights, Customer shall promptly disable such passwords and BB shall not issue any new passwords to any such individual. 

3.7 Customer must not permit any of its Authorised Users to (a) be under the legal age to use the Subscription Services in the country in which the Authorised User resides (or whose laws apply to them); (b) share with or permit access to any Authorised User’s account by multiple people; (c) operate a service or automated account, where there is not a single human individual responsible for that account; or (d) otherwise in breach of its EULA.  If BB determines that there has been a breach of this clause, in addition to its other rights, BB reserves the right to terminate affected Authorised User accounts or the Agreement as noted below. 

3.8 Customer shall not access, store, distribute or transmit any viruses, or any material during the course of its use of the Subscription Services that: (a) is unlawful, harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, infringing, harassing or racially or ethnically offensive; (b) facilitates illegal activity; (c) depicts sexually explicit images; (d) promotes unlawful violence; (e) is discriminatory based on race, gender, colour, religious belief, sexual orientation, disability, or any other illegal activity; or (f) causes damage or injury to any person or property; and BB reserves the right, without liability to Customer, to disable Customer’s access to any material that breaches the provisions of this clause.

3.9 Customer shall not: (a) other than as permitted by law, attempt to copy, modify, duplicate, create derivative works from, frame, mirror, republish, download, display, transmit, or distribute all or any portion of the Software and/or its documentation (as applicable) in any form or media or by any means; nor attempt to reverse compile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise reduce to human-perceivable form all or any part of the Software; or (b) access all or any part of the Subscription Services in order to build, or to facilitate the building of, a product or service which competes with the Subscription Services (and Customer may not access the Subscription Services if it, its Affiliates or any Subscribing Organisations are, or are planning to, build any such product or service); or (c) use the Subscription Services to provide services to third parties (other than any Subscribing Organisations); or (d) subject to clause 17.6, license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, display, disclose, or otherwise commercially exploit, or otherwise make the Services available to any third party except the Authorised Users; or (e) attempt to obtain, or assist third parties in obtaining, access to the Subscription Services, other than as provided under the Agreement; or (f) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Subscription Services or third party data contained therein; or (g) attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Subscription Services or their related systems or networks, including with a view to making alterations to, or modifications of, the whole or any part of the Software, or permitting the Software or any part of it to be combined with, or become incorporated in, any other programs.  

3.10 Customer shall not (i) use or launch any automated system, including, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that sends more request messages to BB’s servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional browser; (ii) use the Subscription Services in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs any of our websites or interferes with any other party's use of the Subscription Services; (iii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Subscription Services; (iv) access the Subscription Services other than through our interface; or (v) use the Subscription Services for any purpose or in any manner that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement.

3.11 Customer may not use the Subscription Services if Customer is legally prohibited from receiving or using same under the laws of the country in which Customer are resident or from which Customer proposes to access or use same. The Subscription Services are not designed to comply with industry-specific regulations such as the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), or other laws relating to industries where financial data or other sensitive information is regularly exchanged, so Customer may not use the Subscription Services where Customer’s communications would be subject to such laws. 

3.12 CUSTOMER AGREES NOT TO USE THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES TO COLLECT, MANAGE OR PROCESS SENSITIVE INFORMATION. BB WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY THAT MAY RESULT FROM CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES TO COLLECT OR MANAGE SENSITIVE INFORMATION. 

3.13 Customer agree to use any Third Party Services only in compliance with any terms of use specified by each relevant site or service. BB do not control such sites or services or the content, messages or information found in or on, or accessible through, same. BB disclaims and will have no liability with regards to such sites or services and any actions resulting from Customer’s use of same. The availability of such sites or services does not mean BB endorses, supports or warrants such sites or services. 

3.14 Customer shall use best endeavours to prevent any unauthorised access to, or use of, the Subscription Services and/or the Documents and, in the event of any such unauthorised access or use, promptly notify BB.

3.15 Customer may, from time to time during the Subscription Term, purchase additional User Licences. Customer shall, within 30 days of the date of BB’s invoice, pay to BB the relevant fees for such additional User Licences and, if such additional User Licences are purchased by Customer part way through the Initial Subscription Term or any Renewal Period (as applicable), to the extent that they form part of a Chargeable Feature, such fees may be pro-rated for the remainder of the Initial Subscription Term or then current Renewal Period (as applicable).

3.16 Customer must ensure that its use of the Subscription Services and all Customer Data is at all times compliant with the terms of the Agreement, all applicable laws and regulations (nationally and internationally) and Customer represents and warrants that: (i) it has obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide all Customer Data to BB and to grant the rights granted to BB in the Agreement and (ii) Customer Data and its transfer to and use by BB as authorized by Customer under the Agreement do not violate any laws (including without limitation those relating to export control and electronic communications) or rights of any third party, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of publicity, and any use, collection and disclosure authorised herein is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy policies. Other than its security obligations under clause 9.5, BB assumes no responsibility or liability for Customer Data, and Customer shall be solely responsible for Customer Data and the consequences of using, disclosing, storing, or transmitting it.

3.17 Customer acknowledges that it has no right to have access to the Software in source code form or in unlocked coding or with comments.

4.2 BB may, from time to time at its discretion, generally upgrade and improve the Software as it sees fit and Customer acknowledges that such upgrades and improvements may affect its use of the Subscription Services. Any specific upgrades requested by Customer, which are technically feasible and agreed by BB, will be separately chargeable.

4.4 BB do not guarantee that the Free Services will be available or uninterrupted. Access to the Free Services is permitted on a temporary basis and BB may suspend, withdraw, discontinue or change all or any part of the Free Services, either generally, for Customer or any of its Authorised User at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. BB will not be liable to Customer or any Authorised User if for any reason the Free Services are unavailable at any time or for any period. 

4.5 Customer may subscribe to upgraded Chargeable Features in respect of the Subscription Services by activating the additional functionality via a separate Checkout Process. This Agreement will apply to all Subscription Services that Customer activates accordingly. Customer shall be entitled to upgrade their subscription to any Chargeable Features (such that the level of Subscription Charges increases) at any time by selecting the appropriate options within their Account. Such upgrades shall take effect on a pro-rated basis (or the basis otherwise specified in the platform) with immediate effect and apply to the end of the then-current Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Period applicable to the specific Chargeable Features ordered by Customer. The subscription level in respect of any Chargeable Features may be downgraded at any time before the 28th day in the month or year immediately before the first month or year of the following Renewal Period. However, any change to Subscription Charges will not take effect before the end of the then-current Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Period, and no refunds will be issued.

4.6 Customer may purchase Consultancy Services by subscribing for these within its account on the BB platform via the Checkout Process.  Unless BB otherwise agrees in writing (including during a relevant Checkout Process), the Consultancy Services BB provide are described in the platform and will be delivered in English.

Consultancy Services may be delivered via hourly slots, or service call time, which Customer may have the option to pay for and schedule via a Checkout Process on the platform.

4.8 BB shall procure hosting of the Software from its hosting sub-contractor and make the Subscription Services available to Customer in accordance with the terms imposed upon it by its hosting sub-contractor from time to time, a copy of which will be provided to Customer upon request.

BB reserves the right to charge additional Subscription Charges, based on BB’s standard rates from time to time (as set out either on BB’s website or otherwise). BB reserves the right to monitor or audit remotely this data by accessing the Subscription Services in connection with any Subscription Charges that are subject to such limits. If such monitoring reveals that Customer has underpaid Subscription Charges to BB, then Customer shall pay to BB an amount equal to such underpayment (as calculated by reference to the additional Subscription Charges for such excessive use historically and over the remainder of the then current minimum term commitment that would apply to any additional Chargeable Features within five (5) Business Days of the date of invoice by BB.

Otherwise, BB gives no warranties in relation to the Services. 

5.2 Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Services are available with only limited functionality when accessed through a mobile or tablet device.

If the Services, Support or Subscription Services do not conform to the undertaking in clause 5.1, BB will, at its expense, use all reasonable commercial endeavours to correct any such non-conformance within a reasonable timeframe, or provide Customer with an alternative means of accomplishing the desired performance. Such correction or substitution constitutes Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of such undertaking. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BB does not warrant that Customer's use of the Subscription Services and Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.

5.4 Customer acknowledges that it has assessed the suitability of the Services for its requirements. BB does not warrant that the Software, the Services and/or their documentation will be suitable for such requirements or that any use will be uninterrupted or error free.     

5.5 The Agreement shall not prevent BB from entering into similar agreements with third parties, or from independently developing, using, selling or licensing documentation, products and/or services which are similar to those provided under the Agreement.

5.6 BB warrants that it has and will maintain all necessary licences, consents, and permissions necessary for the performance of its obligations under the Agreement.

# 7. THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND SOFTWARE (INCLUDING OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE) 

7.1 BB’s Services may from time to time include or feature third party and open-source software components which are subject to certain third party and open source licence terms. Accordingly, any terms and conditions set out at https://budibase.com/licenses, as updated from time to time (without further notice) shall apply to Customer’s and the Authorised Users’ use of the Services in addition to the provisions set out elsewhere in the Agreement, as well as any other relevant third party or open-source licence terms which may apply from time to time. BB warrants that it has procured permission for the use by Customer of such third party or open-source software without any additional cost to Customer, and that Customer will continue to be entitled to use such software during the Term (through and as part of its use of the Subscription Services and subject to any applicable limitations on the use of same) provided that it complies with the terms of the Agreement, including the terms linked above.

7.2 Additionally, Customer may use Third-party Services when accessing the Subscription Services, for example where it downloads an application that integrates with or incorporates the Subscription Services, links from the Subscription Services to another service, or uses a Third Party Service to authenticate its access to the Subscription Services. While the Agreement represents the agreement between BB and Customer, other parties’ terms govern their relationships. Whilst BB takes no responsibility for any Authorised User’s or Customer’s adherence to such terms or the actions taken by such third-parties, Customer warrants and represents that it will honour and adhere to such terms when using the Subscription Services and that Customer will not hold BB responsible for any interactions with such third parties or their terms, including for wrongful or negligent acts or omissions, or breaches of contract. Customer acknowledges that BB cannot be held responsible for any errors or issues with the Subscription Services to the extent attributable to such Third-party Services. 

7.3 BB does not control the content, messages or information found in or on or accessible through Third-party Services. BB disclaims and will have no liability regarding such services and any actions resulting from Customer’s, it Affiliates, Subscribing Organisations or their Authorised Users’ use of the same. The availability of such services does not mean BB endorses, supports or warrants same.

8.1 Customer shall pay the relevant Subscription Charges (and any Consultancy Charges, or other charges specified or agreed) to BB in accordance with the Payment Terms. 

8.2 Customer will keep its contact information, billing information and credit card information (where applicable) up to date through its account.

8.3 If Customer is paying by direct debit, credit card, direct debit or other online payment methods, including Stripe, it authorises BB to charge Customer’s credit card, debit card, bank account or other online payment account for all fees payable during the Subscription Term. Customer further authorise BB to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of Customer’s payment information to such third party. 

8.4 If BB has not received payment of any amount due and owing under the Agreement within ten (10) days after the due date, without prejudice to any of its other rights and remedies: (a) BB may, without liability to Customer, disable Customer’s and any Authorised Users’ passwords, accounts and access to all or part of the Subscription Services (including the Free Services) and BB shall be under no obligation to provide any or all of the Services or Support while the invoice(s) concerned remain unpaid; and (b) interest shall accrue on such due amounts at an annual rate equal to 4% over the then current base lending rate of HSBC plc at the date the relevant invoice was issued, compounded monthly, commencing on the due date and continuing until fully paid, whether before or after judgment (or the highest rate permitted by applicable law). BB also reserves the right to charge Customer its reasonable administration costs, including charges for failed payments and/or its costs in relation to pursuing outstanding amounts (including legal fees and expenses), where BB is not satisfied (in its sole discretion) that Customer has not acted reasonably and in good faith in disputing any amount due and owing. If the Subscription Services are suspended for non-payment or any breach of the Agreement, BB may charge a re-activation fee to re-activate same.

8.5 All amounts and fees stated or referred to in the Agreement: (a) shall be payable in pounds sterling (unless another currency is denominated in the Proposal or as part of the Checkout Process); (b) are non-cancellable and non-refundable; (c) are exclusive of taxes or duties payable under the Agreement as specified below (including VAT or GST), which shall be added to BB’s invoice(s) at the appropriate rate; and (d) be paid by bank transfer in full and cleared funds to the account specified on BB’s invoice, by such other payment method (which must be kept up to date and accurate) as BB may accept from time to time. 

8.6 Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on BB’s net income or gross revenue) imposed or become due in connection with the provision of Services to Customer under the Agreement. If Customer is located in the EU, the Customer must provide BB with the VAT registration number under which Customer is registered in Customer’s member state.  If Customer does not provide BB with a VAT registration number prior to Customer’s transaction being processed, BB will not issue refunds or credits for any VAT that was charged.

8.7 If Customer is required to deduct or withhold any tax, Customer must pay the amount deducted or withheld as required by law and pay BB an additional amount so that BB receives payment in full as if there were no deduction or withholding.

8.8 If, at any time whilst using the Services, Customer exceeds the Licence Restrictions, BB shall charge Customer, and Customer shall pay, BB’s then prevailing charges for such excessive use. 

8.9 BB shall be entitled to increase Subscription Charges and the rate for any Consultancy Charges at any time having given at least fourteen (14)  days’ prior notice to Customer, be entitled to increase the Subscription Charges (including for any additional User Licences purchased) and the Subscription Charges set out in Proposal or agreed via any Checkout Process shall be deemed to have been amended accordingly (unless Customer objects to such increase within 7 (seven) days of notice from BB, which case the Agreement shall not renew into any Renewal Period, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing).


# 9. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND DATA

9.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that BB and/or its licensors own all intellectual property rights in, or arising from, the Services, Software and their documentation. All content on BB’s site and the Subscription Service is copyright © Budibase Limited. The Budibase™ name and brand, as well as any other BB trademarks (word marks, picture marks or integrated marks) and associated unregistered trademarks and trade names used by BB. Except as expressly stated herein, the Agreement does not grant Customer any rights to, or in, patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, trade names, trade marks (whether registered or unregistered), or any other rights or licences in respect of the Services, Software, their documentation and the BB trademark or associated unregistered trademarks. This shall be without prejudice to Customer’s ownership of any background intellectual property rights owned by it separately from the Agreement and/or pre-dating the Agreement. 

9.2 Customer may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of BB’s Software or Services or trademarks, without BB’s express permission, save that Customer may link to BB’s site, provided it does so fairly and legally and in a way that does not damage BB’s reputation or take advantage of it. Customer must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on BB’s part where none exists. Customer must not establish a link to BB’s Site on any website that Customer does not own unless Customer has relevant authorisations. BB reserves the right to withdraw linking permission without notice. The website in which Customer is linking must comply in all respects with the content standards set out in the Agreement and the EULA. BB’s site must not be framed on any other site. BB may withdraw this licence at any time on notice. If Customer has an Account with BB and wish to link to or make any use of Data on our Site other than that set out above, it may contact BB.

9.3 Customer shall own all rights, title and interest in and to all of Customer Data and shall have sole responsibility for the legality, reliability, integrity, accuracy and quality of Customer Data and the means by which it acquired such Customer Data, as well as how it shares and licences its Customer Data with third parties, save as otherwise agreed in writing between Customer and any specific Authorised Users. This shall be provided that BB shall have a lien over all Customer Data in the event of non-payment by Customer of any Charges validly due and owing under the Agreement, where Customer has been notified of non-payment and has failed to remedy such breach (other than as a result of a genuine administrative error, or where BB is satisfied, acting reasonably and in good faith, that Customer has raised some bona fide dispute over specific Charges (and in such circumstances provided that Customer has paid any undisputed sums due and owing)) and BB reserves the right to restrict access to such Customer Data in the event of such non-payment and otherwise delete Customer Data after 90 days’ notice (or 90 days after termination of the Agreement, as noted below) in exercise of its rights of lien. This notwithstanding, BB may use the Personal Data as comprised in the Customer Data as set out in its Privacy Policy from time to time, and shall generally be granted a non-exclusive, royalty free, non sub-licensable, worldwide and non transferable licence to access the Customer Data for the Term (and until such Customer Data is deleted in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement thereafter) 

9.4 Where BB creates any specific content or material for Customer through the Consultancy Services, and such content is unique to such Customer, subject to payment in full of any charges owing under the Agreement, BB agrees to assign all its right and title in the intellectual property rights subsisting in such content to Customer, with effect from the date of its creation. 

9.5 BB shall use reasonable endeavours to maintain appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data. However, Customer understands and acknowledges that use of the Subscription Services necessarily involves transmission of Customer Data over networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by BB, and that BB cannot be held responsible for any Customer Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks. BB does not guarantee that its security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions of Customer Data will always be secure or that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat BB’s security measures or those of BB’s third-party service providers.

9.6 By entering into the Agreement with BB, Customer grants BB and its successors and assigns a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence and right to store, utilise, and display Customer Data (in the manner in which Customer or its Authorised Users have made it available to other Authorised Users), and make copies as set out in clause 9.7 below.  For example, this includes a right to do things like copy it to BB’s database and make backups or to display the Customer Data and share it with other Authorised Users (unless to the extent access is restricted). BB do not sell Customer Data or otherwise distribute or use it outside the context of providing the Subscription Services. This licence will end or be revoked within a certain period of time (our data retention cycles) after the Agreement is terminated, or Customer has deleted all relevant Customer Data. 

9.7 BB shall not modify Customer Data, disclose Customer Data or access Customer Data, which shall be treated as the Confidential Information of Customer, except: (a) as required by law; (b) as expressly permitted by Customer; (c) to provide the Services; (d) to address technical problems or issues with the Services; (e) at Customer’s request when providing Support; or (f) under its lien over such data as contemplated in clause 9.3 above, or as otherwise contemplated under the Agreement. 

9.8 Neither Customer or any Authorised Users may access the Subscription Services where they are engaged as an employee or contractor with any business that competes with BB own or to attempt to gain access to BB’s Confidential Information with a view to building, creating or amending any software or service which competes with any element of the Subscription Service offered by BB. Further, [during the Subscription Term, and for twelve (12) months thereafter, Customer shall not, or attempt to, build or develop any product or service that commercially competes with or is substantially similar to the Software, which it provides or intends to provide to third parties for payment (i.e. which is not solely intended for internal use). This obligation shall cease to apply only where there is no longer a commercial relationship between the parties, and Customer can demonstrate that (a) an independent third party has licensed or sold the Software (or something similar to it) to it on arms’ length terms, and (b) such competing solutions do not incorporate or contain, are not based upon, and do not rely in any way upon any Confidential Information made available by BB to Customer, or to which Customer otherwise gained access, under the Agreement or any previous contract between the parties. 

9.9 If Customer (including its Authorised Users) gives BB any Feedback, it acknowledges and agrees by accepting the Agreement that such Feedback will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and BB will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual licence to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit or incorporate the Feedback into BB’s products, services, and documentation.

9.10 Customer acknowledges that it has no right to access the Software in source code form or unlocked coding or comments.

9.11 BB shall use its reasonable commercial endeavours to back-up all Customer Data on a daily basis but otherwise backup of all Customer Data shall be the sole responsibility of Customer. In the event of any loss of or damage to Customer Data, Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be for BB to use its reasonable commercial endeavours to restore the lost or damaged Customer Data from the latest back-up maintained by BB (or its hosting services provider, as appropriate). Customer should note that BB’s typical retention periods for Customer Data are as set out in its Privacy Policy.


# 10. DATA PROTECTION

10.1 Both parties will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. This clause is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party's obligations under the Data Protection Legislation. 

10.2 The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Legislation, in relation to any Personal Data comprised within Customer Data (Customer Personal Data), Customer is the Data Controller and BB is the Data Processor. Such Personal Data shall only be processed by BB in accordance with any lawful instructions reasonably given by Customer from time to time in writing, as reasonably necessary to fulfil the Agreement (including as required by the underlying operating procedures for the Software) and exercise BB’s rights and obligations hereunder and as applicable in accordance with the terms of  BB’s privacy notice and policy, which is available at https://budibase.com/privacy (Privacy Policy). The Privacy Policy provides detailed notice of BB’s privacy and data use practices concerning any personal data comprised in Customer Data. The parties record their intention that the Agreement represents the data processing agreement envisaged by Article 28 of the EU GDPR (and the equivalent provision under UK GDPR).

10.3 As between the parties, where each party processes any Personal Data provided by or relating to the other party or its employees otherwise than Customer Personal Data, including employee names and email addresses of employees of Customer with whom BB interacts (for example), each party acknowledges that they shall act as a Data Controller in relation to such Personal Data and only process it for specified purposes in accordance with each party’s respective privacy policy for the purposes of contract administration or otherwise in its own legitimate interests, as permitted under applicable laws. 

10.4 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 10.1, Customer must ensure that its use of the Subscription Services and all Customer Data is at all times compliant with the terms of the Agreement, all applicable laws and regulations including Data Protection Law (nationally and internationally) and Customer represents and warrants that: (a) it has obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide all Customer Data to BB for the purposes and duration of the Agreement and to grant the rights granted to BB in the Agreement; and (b) Customer Data and its transfer to and use by BB as authorised by Customer under the Agreement do not violate any laws or rights of any third party, or data subject, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of publicity, and any use, collection and disclosure authorised herein is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy policies. Other than BB’s security obligations under clause 9.3, limited back-up obligations in clause 9.8, and legal obligations under Data Protection Law (as set out in this clause 10.) and confidentiality obligations in clause 11., BB assumes no responsibility or liability for Customer Data, and Customer shall be solely responsible for Customer Data and the consequences of determining the purpose and manner in which Customer Data is to be processed, used, disclosed, stored, or transmitted.

10.5 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 10.1, BB shall, in relation to any Customer Personal Data: (a) process that Customer Personal Data only on the written instructions of Customer unless BB is required by Data Protection Law to otherwise process that Customer Personal Data; (b) ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Customer Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Customer Personal Data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures; (c) ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process Customer Personal Data are obliged to keep Customer Personal Data confidential; (d) not transfer any Customer Personal Data outside of the EEA unless the prior written consent of Customer has been obtained and the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) Customer or BB has provided appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer; (ii) the data subject has enforceable rights and effective legal remedies; (iii) BB complies with its obligations under the Data Protection Law by providing an adequate level of protection to any Customer Personal Data that is transferred; and (iv) BB complies with reasonable instructions notified to it in advance by Customer with respect to the processing of Customer Personal Data; (e) assist Customer, at Customer's cost, in responding to any request from a Data Subject and in ensuring compliance with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators; (e) notify Customer without undue delay on becoming aware of a Personal Data breach; and (f) at the written direction of Customer, delete or return Customer Personal Data and copies thereof to Customer on termination of the agreement unless required by Applicable Law to store Customer Personal Data (subject always to Customer having paid BB any then outstanding charges owing under the Agreement). 

10.6 Customer consents to BB appointing the categories of sub-processor listed in the Privacy Policy, or otherwise notified to Customer from time to time by BB, as third-party processors of any Personal Data processed by BB under the Agreement. BB confirms that it has entered or (as the case may be) will enter with such third-party processors into a written agreement substantially on those third parties’ standard terms of business (which shall at a minimum require such sub-processors to treat any Customer Data as confidential and process any Customer Personal Data in compliance with Data Protection Law). As between the parties, BB shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of any third-party processor appointed by it pursuant to this clause 10.6. 


# 11. CONFIDENTIALITY

11.1 Neither party will use the other’s Confidential Information except as permitted under the Agreement. Each party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other party’s Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its information of a confidential and proprietary nature but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorised disclosure of the other party’s Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information strictly only to those of its or its Affiliates’ employees, representatives, consultants, contractors or agents (together Representatives) who need to know such information, are subject to restrictions around the use of such Confidential Information substantially similar to those set out in this clause. Each party shall be liable and responsible for its Representatives’ adherence to such terms. The preceding obligations will not restrict either party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party under the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other party to enable such party to contest such order or requirement (to the extent permitted by law). 

11.2 For the avoidance of doubt, BB considers Customer Data not publicly disclosed by Customer to be Customer’s Confidential Information and will protect and keep confidential such Confidential Information per (this) clause 11.. BB may access and use such Confidential Information under the following circumstances (a) with Customer’s consent and knowledge, for support reasons; (b) if it have reason to believe such Confidential Information violates the law or of the Agreement (including the EULA in respect of a specific Authorised User’s usage), in which case it reserves the right to access, review, and remove them; (c) where it is compelled by law to disclose Customer’s Confidential Information; or (d) when access is required for operational or security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of BB's Subscription Services (in which case access will be limited to specifically authorised personnel and only exercised to the extent necessary to facilitate such purposes). 

11.3 Customer is responsible for managing access to its account and Customer Data stored thereon, including invitations, administrative control, and access. BB is not responsible for the actions of any of Customer’s Authorised Users in this regard. Nor is BB responsible for any third party’s or Authorised User’s adherence to any terms imposed by Customer as a pre-requisite for access to its Customer Data. 

11.4 In accessing the Subscription Services, Customer and its Authorised Users may also gain access to information relating to Beta Previews which BB considers to be Confidential Information, and Customer agrees on behalf of itself and its Authorised Users to protect and keep strictly confidential such Confidential Information per this clause 11.. 


# 12. NON-SOLICITION

12.1 During the Term and for 12 months thereafter, neither party, directly or indirectly, will solicit for employment or for engagement as an independent contractor, or encourage leaving its employment or engagement, any employee or independent contractor of the other party known to the soliciting party solely through the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, general public advertisements for employment or engagement and any individual’s response thereto will not be deemed a violation of this clause. 


# 13. INDEMNITY– CUSTOMER’S ATTENTION IS PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO THIS CLAUSE

13.1 Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless BB against claims, actions, proceedings, losses, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation court costs and reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with its and/or the Authorised Users’ use of the Services and Software including, without limitation, for any liability, damages, costs or claims incurred by BB due to Customer’s use of the Services or Software for any purpose outside of the Purpose or any claim relating to Customer Data, including, without limitation, any claim brought by a third party alleging that Customer Data, or Customer’s use of the Services or Software in breach of the Agreement infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law, save to the extent directly attributable to BB’s breach of the Agreement, or any claim from a third party in consequence of their use of, and/or reliance on, any output of the Subscription Services. 

13.2 Where Customer is paying any Subscription Charges, BB shall, subject to the other provisions of this clause 13. and the limitations in clause 14., defend Customer against any third party claim that the Subscription Services infringe any copyright, trade mark, patent or right of confidentiality and shall indemnify Customer for any amounts awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction against Customer in final judgment or settlement of such claims, or agreed to by BB, provided that: (a) BB is given prompt notice of any such claim, together with all relevant details of the claim; (b) Customer provides reasonable co-operation to BB in the defence and settlement of such claim, at BB’s expense; and (c) BB is given sole authority to defend or settle the claim, and Customer does not compromise, settle or admit liability with respect to any claim without BB’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). This indemnity shall not apply to any Free Services or Third-Party Services. 

13.3 In the defence or settlement of any claim, BB may procure the right for Customer to continue using the Subscription Services, replace or modify the Subscription Services so that they become non-infringing or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, terminate the Agreement without any additional liability or obligation to pay liquidated damages or other additional costs to Customer. 

13.4 In no event shall BB, its employees, agents and sub-contractors be liable to Customer to the extent that the alleged infringement is based on: (a) a modification of the Software or Subscription Services by anyone other than BB or BB's authorised contractors or agents or (b) Customer's use of the Services in a manner contrary to the instructions given to Customer by BB or BB's authorised contractors or agents; (c) Customer's use of the Subscription Services after notice of the alleged or actual infringement from BB or any appropriate authority; or (d) any element of the Software (or the Customer Data’s integration with same) not attributable to BB (for example, due to any Third-party Services, Customer databases, or bespoke upgrades to the Software undertaken at Customer’s direction incorporating content provided by Customer).  

13.5 The foregoing provisions of clause 13. state Customer's sole and exclusive rights and remedies, and BB’s (including BB’s employees’, agents’ and sub-contractors’) entire obligations and liability, for infringement of any patent, copyright, trade mark, database right or right of confidentiality.

14.6 BB shall have no liability to Customer whatsoever in respect of the Free Services or THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, or any claims, causes of action, liabilities or losses which may arise in respect of, or in connection with same.

14.7 Without prejudice to the generality of the other limitations in this clause, Customer acknowledges and accepts that the Services have not been developed or programmed specifically to meet its requirements, and that it is therefore its sole responsibility to ensure that the functions of the Services meet such requirements.

14.8 Customer acknowledges and accepts that BB shall have no liability or responsibility for ensuring that such Customer Tools (as developed by Customer’s Authorised Users) are compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory or industry standards or requirements to which Customer may be subject, or which may be relevant to same (the Relevant Standards), nor that such Customer Tools are in any way adequate, complete, relevant and/or appropriate for the purposes for which they are intended, either at the time they are set or at any point in the future

Customer warrants and undertakes that its Authorised Users have and will exercise same, and appropriate judgment, when using the Subscription Services.

Customer also generally warrants on an ongoing basis that it will comply with all laws in Customer’s use of the Services, including any applicable export laws.  

14.12 Customer acknowledges and accepts that the above limitations, and those outlined elsewhere in the Agreement, are fair, proportionate and reasonable in light of, among other things, the nature of the Subscription Services (including the acknowledgements outlined in this clause).

15.3 Customer acknowledges and agrees that access and use of any applicable Free Services or Beta Services BB offers constitutes reasonable and sufficient consideration. In return for that access, Customer is willing to adhere to the terms of the Agreement.  

15.4 As a Beta Services user, Customer may get access to information that isn't yet publicly available about new products and features that BB plans to offer. Given the nature of this information, it is important that Customer keeps it confidential. Customer agrees that any Beta Service information that isn't yet in the public domain, for example, information about a preview for a new Beta Service, is BB’s Confidential Information, whether or not expressly labelled as such. Customer agrees only to use such Confidential Information to test and evaluate the Beta Service (the Purpose), not for any other purpose. Customer also agrees not to disclose, publish, or share any Confidential Information with or to any third party unless it has set up the Beta Service in such a way that expressly encourages this (for example, where Customer is part of a forum BB has organised to trial or discuss a new Beta Service). 

15.5 BB’s Confidential Information relating to Beta Services does not include information that is: (a) (or becomes) publicly available without breach of the Agreement through no act or inaction on Customer’s part (for example, where a previously private Beta Service is rolled out as a regular Service by us); (b) independently developed by Customer without breach of any confidentiality obligation to BB or any third party; or (c) disclosed with Customer’s express written permission from BB. If Customer is required to disclose Confidential Information according to any order by a court or regulatory authority with jurisdiction over BB, it may do so provided that BB has been given reasonable advance written notice to object (unless prohibited by law) and the disclosure is limited to the maximum extent possible to comply with such an order of law. 


# 16. TERM, TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION 

16.1 The Agreement shall commence on the Commencement Date, or the date the Proposal is agreed or signed by both parties or the Checkout Process is completed by Customer and confirmed by BB (as applicable), whichever is earlier, and shall (unless terminated earlier in accordance with these terms) continue in full force and effect until the end of the Subscription Term.   

16.2 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies to which the parties may be entitled, either party may terminate the Agreement without liability to the other if: (a) the other party commits a material breach of any of the terms of the Agreement and (if such a breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within 30 days of that party being notified in writing of the breach; or (b)  an order is made or a resolution is passed for the winding up of the other party or if an order is made for the appointment of an administrator to manage the affairs, business and property of the other party, or if such an administrator is appointed or if documents are filed with the court for the appointment of an administrator or if notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given by the other party or its directors or by a qualifying charge holder, or if a receiver is appointed of any of the other party’s assets or undertaking or if circumstances arise which entitle the court or a creditor to appoint a receiver or manager or which entitle the court to make a winding-up order or if the other party takes or suffers any similar or analogous action in consequence of debt; or (c) the other party ceases, or threatens to cease, to trade. 

16.3 BB may also terminate the Agreement (a) for cause on fourteen (14) days’ notice if BB determines that Customer is acting, or has acted, in a way that has or may negatively reflect on or affect BB, BB’s prospects, or BB’s customers; (b) immediately, if Customer has persistently breached the Agreement; or (c) on fourteen (14) days' written notice to Customer in the event that, in BB’s reasonable opinion, Customer’s financial position is such that Customer’s capability to adequately fulfil its obligations under the Agreement is in material jeopardy. 

16.4 Save as specified in the Agreement, and to the extent permitted by law, the Agreement may not otherwise be terminated prior to the end of the Subscription Term. 

16.5 BB may immediately suspend any Authorised User’s access to any or all Subscription Services without notice for: (i) use of the Subscription Services in a way that violates applicable laws or regulations or the terms of the Agreement or the EULA, (ii) posting or uploading material that infringes or is alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of any person or relevant law, or (iii) to protect the integrity, operability, and security of the Subscription Services. BB may, without notice, review, edit and delete any Customer Data that BB has reason to determine in good faith violates the Agreement or the terms of the EULA, provided that the parties acknowledge and agree that BB has no duty to, and shall not, pre-screen, control, monitor or edit Customer Data. BB will, in its discretion and using good faith, tailor any suspension as needed to preserve the integrity, operability, and security of the Subscription Services.

16.6 The Subscription Term for the Free Services shall continue indefinitely from the Commencement Date, unless and until terminated at any time by either party. Such termination may be effected by Customer closing its account with immediate effect (unless Customer has subscribed for any Chargeable Features, in which case the Subscription Term shall continue unless and until the subscription term for all such Chargeable Features has ended). As regards Chargeable Features, following expiry of the Initial Subscription Term or (as applicable) any following Renewal Period for specific Chargeable Features, the Subscription Term shall automatically renew over subsequent Renewal Periods unless and until either party gives notice to the other in writing (including by email) that it does not wish the Agreement to continue beyond the then current Renewal Period or Initial Subscription Term (as applicable), such notice to expire no later than 14 days  prior to the end of the then current Renewal Period or Initial Subscription Term (as applicable). 

16.7 Customer shall be entitled to upgrade its subscription to the Subscription Services (such that Subscription Charges are payable for new Chargeable Features) at any time, by selecting the relevant options within the Software platform, and such upgrades shall take effect on a pro-rated basis (or the basis otherwise specified in the platform) with immediate effect. 

16.8 The subscription level may not be downgraded before the end of the then current Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Period, and Customer may serve notice that it wishes to downgrade its subscription no later than 30 days prior to the end of the then current Renewal Period or Initial Subscription Term (as applicable). Such downgrade shall take effect from the end of such applicable period. 

16.9 Customer makes no commitment to purchase Chargeable Features from BB by availing of any Free Services (unless otherwise agreed by Customer during the Checkout Process). 

16.10 On expiry or termination of the Agreement for any reason: (a) the Customer’s right to access or use the Subscription Services and any BB Data or Confidential Information shall immediately cease; (b) BB may offer Customer Free Services for a time limited period to allow them to stay on, in which case the Agreement shall continue to apply (but subject to the provisions around such Free Services) and Customer’s Authorised User accounts shall remain open (subject always to BB’s right to cancel or close same, and withdraw the offer of Free Services) at any time; (c) each party shall return and make no further use of any Confidential Information belonging to the other party (save for any access required by BB pursuant to sub-clause (b) above; (d) the accrued rights of the parties as at expiry or termination, or the continuation after expiry or termination of any provision expressly stated to survive (including, without limitation, clauses 1., 2., 7. to 12. (inclusive), 13.1, 14., 15.4 to 15.5 (inclusive), this clause 16.10 and clause 17.) or implicitly surviving termination, shall not be affected or prejudiced; (e) as long as Customer has paid all fees owed to BB, if Customer make a written request within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration, BB will provide Customer with temporary access to the Subscription Services to retrieve, or BB will provide Customer with copies of, all Customer Data then in BB’s possession or control. If BB provides Customer with temporary access to the account, BB may charge a re-activation fee. BB may withhold access to Customer Data until Customer pay any fees owed to BB.  After termination or expiration of the Agreement, BB will have no obligation to maintain or provide Customer the Customer Data and may, unless legally prohibited, delete all Customer Data in BB’s systems or otherwise in BB’s control. Customer shall pay all reasonable expenses incurred by BB in returning or disposing of Customer Data; and (f) if Customer has validly and lawfully terminated the Agreement for cause in accordance with clause 16.2, BB will promptly refund any prepaid but unused fees covering use of any Chargeable Features after termination up to the end of any prepaid Subscription Term for such Chargeable Features. If BB has terminated the Agreement for cause, Customer will promptly pay all unpaid fees due through the end of the Subscription Term. Fees are otherwise non-refundable.

 


# 17. GENERAL 

17.1 BB shall have no liability to Customer under the Agreement if it is prevented from or delayed in performing its obligations under the Agreement, or from carrying on its business, by acts, events, omissions or accidents beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes (whether involving the workforce of BB or any other party), failure of a utility service or transport or telecommunications network, act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation or direction, accident, breakdown of plant or machinery, fire, flood, storm or default of Suppliers or sub-contractors, provided that Customer is notified of such an event and its expected duration.

17.2 A waiver of any right under the Agreement is only effective if it is in writing and it applies only to the party to whom the waiver is addressed and to the circumstances for which it is given. No delay in exercising any right or remedy or failure to object will be a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion will not be a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.

17.3 Unless specifically provided otherwise, rights arising under the Agreement are cumulative and do not exclude rights provided by law.

17.4 If any provision (or part of a provision) of the Agreement is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in force. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the commercial intention of the parties.

17.5 The Agreement, and any documents referred to in it, constitute the whole agreement between the parties and supersede any previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between them relating to the subject matter they cover. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agreement shall apply to the exclusion of any terms introduced by Customer, through custom, dealing or otherwise. BB’s obligations are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features of the Subscription Services or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by BB regarding future functionality or features of the Subscription Services.

17.6 Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of BB (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), assign, transfer, charge, sub-contract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the Agreement. BB shall be free to assign, transfer, charge, sub-contract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the Agreement without the consent of Customer but providing notice of any assignment or transfer. BB may also appoint a suitably qualified sub-contractor to perform or provide certain Services on its behalf. Customer will continue to be liable to pay BB any fees due under the Agreement and shall not be liable directly for any of the subcontractor’s fees or expenses. BB shall remain responsible for the performance by its sub-contractor of any sub-contracted Services and shall not sub-contract the Subscription Services in their entirety. 

17.7 Nothing in the Agreement is intended to or shall operate to create a partnership between the parties or authorise either party to act as agent for the other, and neither party shall have the authority to act in the name or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including, but not limited to, the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power).

17.8 Other than our third party licensors (who may enforce the applicable licences you have agreed under clause 7.1 directly), notwithstanding any other provisions of the Agreement, nothing in the Agreement confers or purports to confer any right to enforce any of its terms on any person who is not a party to it, and any such person shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (or otherwise) to enforce any term of the Agreement.

17.9 Any notice required or permitted to be given under the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered or transmitted to the intended recipient's address as specified in the Agreement or such other address as either party may notify in writing to the other from time to time for this purpose. It may also, in the case of notice by BB only, be generally notified to Customers via their account, or notified by way of email to the email address BB has on account for a given Customer. Any notice shall be treated as having been served on delivery if delivered by hand or 4 Business Days after posting if sent by pre-paid first-class post. In the case of notice served by posting on the website or by email, the notice shall be deemed given at the time such upload goes live onto the website and at the time of transmission of the email (respectively).  

17.10 The construction, validity and performance of the Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Northern Ireland, and the parties submit any dispute regarding the construction, validity and performance of the Agreement, or its subject matter, or any non-contractual disputes, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Northern Ireland.

17.11 Where any Proposal is issued or signed it may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together will constitute the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed valid Proposal (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission, or signature via DocuSign or other EIDAS compliant signature platform, or Customer’s confirmation by email of its agreement to the terms of a valid Proposal, shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

17.12 Similarly, the completion of the Checkout Process by Customer or on its behalf (including Customer’s indicating its acceptance of these General Terms by click- through appropriate acceptance method) and acceptance of the customer’s order by BB (either in-platform or by email confirmation) shall also be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The Agreement is a contract for the provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. Where Customer is based in the USA the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA), or any substantially similar legislation as enacted, shall not apply to this Agreement. If Customer is based outside the USA, the parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not govern the Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties under it.

17.13 All Professional Services and Support, the Agreement and any correspondence between the parties regarding the subject matter of the Agreement (including any dispute) shall be exclusively in the English language. 

17.14 BB might make versions of the Agreement available in languages other than English. If BB does, the English version of the Agreement will govern the parties’ relationship. The translated version is provided for convenience only and will not be interpreted to modify the English version of this Agreement. 

17.15 Unless otherwise stated in these General Terms, no amendment or variation of the Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the parties (or their authorised representatives). The above notwithstanding, BB may update and change any part or all of these General Terms, (other than those relating to fees and charges) at any time. If BB update or change these General Terms or any other document comprising part of the Agreement, and the updated General Terms or constituent document will be posted at the URL at which Customer originally accessed it and BB will let Customer know via email or through a pop-up notification when using the Software. The updated document will become effective and binding on the next Business Day after notice of any update is so given. When BB change any document, the "Last Updated" date and version reference in the relevant document (e.g., clause 1.5 of these General Terms) will be updated to reflect the date of the most recent version. BB encourages Customer to review the documents forming part of the Agreement periodically. Every time Customer completes the Checkout Process for new or extended Chargeable Features, or signs a new Proposal, the terms applying to the Agreement between the Parties shall be as outlined in the relevant version of these General Terms linked (in either the Proposal or as part of the Checkout Process) at the time.

17.16 Each party (including in the case of the Customer, the person completing the Checkout Process or signing the Proposal in their individual capacity) represents and warrants to the other that it has full power and authority to enter into the Agreement (or to act on behalf of the party on whose behalf it purports to act) and that it is binding upon such party and enforceable in accordance with its terms.
