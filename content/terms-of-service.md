These Terms of Service are effective immediately for users who create accounts or otherwise accept these Terms of Service on or after the "Last Modified" date above.

These Terms of Service (these "Terms") of Budibase Ltd ("we," "our," or "us") are an agreement that describes your rights and responsibilities as a Budibase customer.

More specifically, these Terms govern how you may access and use: (i) budi.live, its subdomains, and any other website where these Terms are posted; (ii) Budibases’s online hosted services. These terms do not govern Budibase's open source products, which are governed by their respective open source licenses.

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. BY CREATING AN BUDIBASE ACCOUNT, CLICKING "SIGN UP", "SIGN UP WITH GOOGLE", "SIGN UP FOR FREE", "SUBMIT", OR THE LIKE INDICATING ACCEPTANCE ELECTRONICALLY, OR BY ACCESSING OR USING BUDIBASE HOSTING, YOU SIGNIFY THAT YOU HAVE READ, HAVE UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, AND THAT YOU HAVE READ, HAVE UNDERSTOOD, AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AT BUDIBASE.COM/PRIVACY ("PRIVACY POLICY"), WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE A REGISTERED USER OF BUDIBASE. WE RESERVE ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED UNDER THESE TERMS. 

If you are an individual and you access or use Budibase on behalf of a company, principal, or other entity, such as your employer (each, together with its affiliates, an "Organization"), then: (i) these Terms of Service are an agreement between us and you and us and that Organization; (ii) you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms (and if you do not have the authority, you may not access or use Budibase); (iii) your acceptance of these Terms will bind such Organization to these Terms; (iv) your individual right to access and use Budibase may be suspended or terminated (and ownership and administration of your Budibase Account may be transferred) if you cease to be associated with, or cease to use an email address associated with or provisioned by, that Organization; (v) we may disclose information regarding you and your use of the Service with such Organization; and (vi) the terms "you" and "your", as used in these Terms, refer to both you and such Organization. If you sign up for Budibase using an email address associated with or provisioned by an Organization, or if an Organization pays fees due in connection with your access to or use of Budibase (or reimburses you for payment of such fees), or otherwise, then we may deem you, in our sole discretion, to be accessing and using Budibase on behalf of that Organization.

## 1. Our Service
### 1.1 Eligibility

You may use Budibase only if you can form a legally binding contract with us (and on behalf of your Organization as applicable), and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. To use Budibase, you must be at least 13 years old, and in some circumstances even older (please check your local law for the age of digital consent). You represent and warrant that you meet the applicable age requirements and are competent to agree to these Terms, or, if you are unable to form a binding contract under applicable law, you represent and warrant that you have your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to use Budibase, and that your parent or legal guardian is agreeing to these Terms concurrently. If you are a parent or legal guardian of an Budibase user who is unable to form a binding contract under applicable law, you are agreeing to these Terms and you are responsible for such Budibase user’s activity on Budibase. Budibase is not available to any users who were previously removed from the Service.

### 1.2 Access, Restrictions, and Use

### 1.3 Budibase Accounts

Your account on Budibase (your "Budibase Account") gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time. We may maintain different types of Budibase Accounts for different types of users. You acknowledge that you do not own your Budibase Account.

You may not use another user’s Budibase Account without such user’s permission. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Budibase Account, and you must keep your Budibase Account password(s) strong and secure. You should notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Budibase Account. Any individual with administrator-level access to your Budibase Account can modify your Budibase Account settings, access and billing information. We will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Budibase Account, or for any changes to your Budibase Account, including your ability to access your Budibase Account or Your Content (defined below), made by any individual with administrator-level access to your Budibase Account.

You may control certain aspects of your Budibase Account profile and how you interact with Budibase by changing the settings in your settings page. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other marketing or advertising messages, such as changes to features of Budibase and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences by contacting Budibase Support at support@budibase.com or by clicking the unsubscribe link within each marketing or advertising message. Opting out will not prevent you from receiving Service-related notices.
1.4 Your Content

As between us and you, you (or your licensors) will own any and all information, data, and other content, in any form or medium, that is collected, downloaded, or otherwise received, directly or indirectly, from you (or on your behalf) by or through Budibase ("Your Content"). For an Organizational account, we may assume, in our sole discretion, that all of Your Content belongs to that Organization.

You (on behalf of yourself and your Organization, if applicable, and your other licensors) grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, us an irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), fully paid, royalty-free, and worldwide right and license to use, copy, store, modify, and display Your Content: (i) to provide, maintain, and improve Budibase; (ii) to perform such other actions as authorized by you in connection with your use of Budibase; and (iii) for any other purpose consistent with the Privacy Policy.

If you are an individual using Budibase on behalf of an Organization and are collaborating with other employees or other individuals who have access to Your Content under your Budibase Account, or if you share Your Content with other individuals within or outside of such Organization, the content on your Budibase Account that you make available to such other individuals (as well as other information, such as the names and contact information of other individuals who have access to your workspace(s) or Your Content within Budibase) will be visible, accessible, and, depending on their designated level of access, editable by such individuals.

You can remove Your Content from your Budibase Account by deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of Your Content may not be completely removed. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of any of Your Content, or any failure to remove or delete such content.

In connection with Your Content, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have all necessary rights, licenses and consents to provide, receive, access and/or use Your Content and any other content you provide, receive, access and/or use through or in connection with Budibase; and (ii) Your Content and our use thereof as contemplated by these Terms and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any intellectual property rights and privacy rights.

We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Your Content. You shall be solely responsible for Your Content and the consequences of posting it, publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on Budibase. You shall be solely responsible and indemnify us for Your Content.

### 1.5 Software

To the extent you receive our Software, subject to your compliance with these Terms, during the applicable Subscription Term, we grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right and license to use our Software solely as reasonably necessary for your use of Budibase in accordance with these Terms.

### 1.6 Service Changes, Suspension, and Termination

You may cancel your Budibase Account at any time, though we will be sorry to see you go. We may change Budibase, stop providing Budibase or features of Budibase to you or to our users generally, or create usage limits for Budibase. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to Budibase without notice and liability, without cause or for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of these Terms. Upon termination, you continue to be bound by these Terms.

## 2. Our Intellectual Property

You acknowledge and agree that Budibase and all materials and content displayed or made available on Budibase, and all software, algorithms, code, technology and intellectual property underlying and included in or with Budibase, and all intellectual property rights therein and thereto throughout the world (collectively and individually, our "Intellectual Property"), are our (or our licensors’ as applicable) sole and exclusive property. Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to create a license in or under any intellectual property rights, and you agree not to access, sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any of our Intellectual Property.

You may choose to, or we may invite you to submit, comments, feedback or ideas about Budibase, including without limitation about how to improve Budibase or our products ("Feedback"). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that Budibase will own such Feedback, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, we do not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to us, or developed by our employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

## 3. Developers

### 3.1 Responsibility for Your Applications

You are solely responsible for all maintenance and support for your Applications, and you will ensure that your Applications comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy, data security, advertising, and marketing laws and regulations, and with all technical and compatibility requirements provided in our documentation. We disclaim all responsibility and liability related to your Applications. You must make any use of your Applications by third parties (including without limitation other Budibase users) subject to a privacy policy and terms and conditions that comply with applicable law and that accurately and plainly describe your and our collection, use, storage, and sharing of such third parties’ personal and confidential data in connection with your Applications and our Service. For clarity, you will retain ownership of your Applications, subject to our rights in our APIs and our Service. We reserve the right to audit your Applications to determine whether they violate these Terms.

## 4. Charges and Payment

### 4.1 Subscription Plans

We may offer plans that you can sign up for that allow you to use certain aspects of Budibase, either for free or for a fee (a "Subscription Plan"). We may change Subscription Plans by offering new services for additional fees and charges and adding or amending fees and charges for existing Subscription Plans in our sole discretion. Any change to a Subscription Plan’s pricing or payment terms will become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in these Terms. Subscription Plans may set allotments for use of designated Service aspects. Use of Service aspects in excess of a Subscription Plan’s designated allotment may result in (additional) fees, as specified in the plan, and such fees will be included in a true-up invoice or charged automatically via the payment method associated with your Budibase Account ("Payment Method").

### 4.2 Billing and Payment

For any paid Subscription Plan, you agree to make payments, and we may automatically charge your Payment Method, as described below, for so long as your Budibase Account remains active. Subscription Plans may be offered for a set subscription period (each such period, a "Subscription Term"). If you elect to use a paid Subscription Plan, you agree to the pricing and payment terms specified at checkout, at Budibase.com/pricing, as otherwise posted or communicated to you, as we may update them from time to time. You must provide Budibase with a current, valid, accepted Payment Method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, you authorize us to provide your payment information to third parties so we can complete your transaction and to charge your Payment Method, in United States dollars, for the type of transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) and any applicable recurring charges as described below. You will pay applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such transaction and are also responsible for any payment-related fees such as wire transfer fees, credit card processing fees, and foreign transaction fees. We currently use Stripe as our third party service provider for payment services, and by using Budibase you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Services Agreement, available at stripe.com/us/legal. If your payment is not successfully settled for any reason, you remain responsible for any amounts not remitted to us. All payments for transactions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.

### 4.3 Renewals

Your subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of Budibase in accordance with these Terms. All Subscription Plans will automatically renew until cancelled by you for renewal terms equal in length to the original Subscription Term. If you do not want a Subscription Plan to renew, you must cancel it at least thirty (30) days before the end of the Subscription Term by providing written notice to us of such cancellation (including by email to support@Budibase.com or via your account settings page on your Budibase Account). If you purchase a Subscription Plan, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you each year on the anniversary of the commencement of your subscription, using the payment information you have provided, until you cancel your subscription. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription Plan, you acknowledge that your Subscription Plan has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your subscription by you or us.

### 4.4 Cancellations

If we terminate your Subscription Plan, except in the event of your breach or failure to pay fees when due, we will grant you a prorated refund for the remaining unused portion of your Subscription Term. You are not entitled to a refund for any Subscription Plan that you cancel. If you cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, your right to use Budibase will continue until the end of your then-current Subscription Term and then terminate without further charges.

### 4.5 Late Payments

Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less (plus the costs of collection).

## 6. Privacy

We care about the privacy of our users. By using Budibase you acknowledge that we may collect, use, and disclose your personal information and aggregate and/or anonymized data as set forth in our Privacy Policy, available at budibase.com/privacy, and acknowledge that you may have your personal information collected, used, transferred to and processed in the United States. If your use of the Service requires us to process any personal data or personal information, as these terms are defined in and in accordance with applicable privacy laws or regulations, we will do so at all times in accordance with our Data Processing Addendum (our "DPA"), which you may access and sign here. Once executed, the DPA will be incorporated into these Terms by reference.

## 7. Security

We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure Your Content from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use Your Content for improper purposes. You understand that internet technologies have the inherent potential for disclosure. You acknowledge that you provide Your Content at your own risk. You can learn more about our security practices at Budibase.com/security.

## 8. Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us and our affiliates, agents, suppliers or licensors (and our and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors) harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your access to or use of Budibase; (ii) your violation of any aspect of these Terms, including without limitation your breach of any of your representations and warranties; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) Your Content, including without limitation any misleading, false, or inaccurate information in Your Content; (vi) your willful misconduct; or (vii) any third party’s access to or use of Budibase with your username(s), password(s) or other security code(s).

## 11. Confidentiality

### 11.1 Confidential Information

From time to time, either party to these Terms (the "Disclosing Party") may disclose or make available to the other (the "Receiving Party") non-public, proprietary, or confidential information of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes any information that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of the Receiving Party's breach of this confidentiality section; (ii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information; (iii) was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to the Disclosing Party's disclosure thereof; or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

### 11.2 Protection and Use of Confidential Information

The Receiving Party shall: (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially-reasonable degree of care; (ii) only use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, and only permit it to be accessed or used, for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Terms, or for any other purpose consistent with the Privacy Policy; and (iii) not disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Receiving Party's service providers or financial/legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms.

### 11.3 Compelled Access or Disclosure

If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure, use commercially-reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.

### 11.4 Injunctive Relief

Each of the parties to these Terms acknowledges that the other party will be irreparably harmed if Confidential Information of the other is distributed in breach of this Section, and that such other party would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of such an actual or threatened breach. Therefore, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened breaches of this Section by the other party without the necessity of showing actual damages or showing that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy.

## 12. Publicity Rights

We may identify you as an Budibase customer in our promotional materials. We will promptly stop doing so upon your request sent to legal@budibase.com.

## 13. General

### 13.1 Assignment

We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as we determine in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain notifications as required under applicable laws or as described in these Terms or our Privacy Policy.

These Terms apply to and govern your access to and use of our Service effective as of the start of your access to or use of our Service, even if such access or use began before publication of these Terms. Your continued use of Budibase after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) Budibase.

### 13.3 Entire Agreement/Severability

These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with us in connection with Budibase, will constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning Budibase. None of our employees or representatives are authorized to make any modification or addition to these Terms. Any statements or comments made between you and any of our employees or representatives are expressly excluded from these Terms and will not apply to you or us or your use of Budibase. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement will be unenforceable.

### 13.4 No Waiver

No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
