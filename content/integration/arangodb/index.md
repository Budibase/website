Budibase integrates with ArangoDB allowing you to use ArangoDB as your data source for your applications. ArangoDB is a free and open-source native multi-model database system developed by ArangoDB GmbH. The database system supports three data models with one database core and a unified query language AQL. The query language is declarative and allows the combination of different data access patterns in a single query.
