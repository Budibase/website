A Comma-separated values file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values.
Easily upload data to Budibase using CSVs. When you upload your CSV, Budibase will recognise the column/field names. You then have the ability to change the data type of the column, and remove if you like, before uploading to Budibase.
