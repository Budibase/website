15.4 This EULA, and any documents referred to in it, constitute the whole agreement between you and us and supersede any previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between them relating to their subject matter. 

15.5 Other than our affiliated companies (who may enforce the relevant provisions of this EULA), and our third party licensors (who may enforce the applicable licences you have agreed under clause 14.1 directly), nothing in this EULA confers or purports to confer any right to enforce any of its terms on any person who is not a party to it, and any such person shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (or otherwise) to enforce any term of this EULA.
