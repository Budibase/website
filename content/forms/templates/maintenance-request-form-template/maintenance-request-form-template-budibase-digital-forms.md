Almost every business manages equipment, either internally, or on behalf of clients and tenants. Inevitably, this also means organizing repairs and maintenance for equipment users. This can be part of regular serving, or in response to an emergency. 

In either case, the key is to have smooth and efficient workflows in place. When repairs and maintenance are delayed, it can disrupt your employees’ work, or negatively impact clients.

Digital maintenance request forms are a simple and effective way to avoid this.

## What is a maintenance request form?

A maintenance request form is a simple interface that allows users to report issues with their equipment, devices, vehicles, or property. This helps you manage issues, and schedule maintenance work.

The goal is to make maintenance requests more efficient, as well as optimize workflows for sending out repair staff. Maintenance request forms can greatly reduce lead times, and cut admin work, helping to lower operational costs.

### How do digital forms work?

Like any digital form, a maintenance request app has two core elements:

1. A front-end interface where users can submit maintenance requests.
2. A back-end database, for storing, managing, and responding to requests.

When a user submits a maintenance request through the front end, an entry is created in the database. This includes the user’s personal information and phone numbers, as well as key details about their maintenance needs.

Your team can then manipulate, query, and respond to requests within the template. Alternatively, you can set rules and conditions to automatically add maintenance work to your team’s schedule.

### Why do businesses need maintenance request forms?

Digital forms offer a more effective maintenance experience for clients, tenants, and internal teams alike. Implementing a work order request form eliminates the need to schedule maintenance manually, either by phone, email, or in person.

Customers can request maintenance much more quickly, at a time that suits them. With a maintenance request form, you can also empower customers to schedule work at a time that suits them.

Additionally, digital forms reduce the workload of your service team. From streamlining customer contact to eliminating administrative tasks, digital service requests are an easy way to cut operating costs.

### Instant maintenance requests

With our template, requesting work takes seconds. Users can simply input their personal details, and information on the issue they’re experiencing. In a fraction of the time it would take to make a phone call, their request will be logged and stored.

Depending on your resources, you can even allow users to schedule their own maintenance, with a date selector field.

Use automated workflows to instantly notify service team members of new requests, or add tasks to their calendar app. You can then notify users when their request’s status changes.

### Assign, approve & action

A maintenance request form is the first step towards building the perfect servicing workflows. Our template provides you with a central repository of your maintenance requests. This allows you to more effectively manage work orders.

Automatically assign different kinds of maintenance requests to different users, or delegate work based on availability.

Our template offers data fields for your team to alter the status of requests and provide additional notes. With our low-code builder, you can quickly and easily build additional app screens to match your maintenance workflows.

### Improved reporting

Digital maintenance requests also help to build oversight within your organization. Building a digital record of your servicing and repairs allows you to analyze trends. That way, you can carry out preventive maintenance, before issues occur.

Over time, this can also improve procurement decision-making. Certain kinds of devices and equipment may require less maintenance than others. Tools with a high maintenance cost can then be avoided.

Improved reporting also improves the outcomes of your maintenance work. For instance, you might use your maintenance request database to track trends in first-contact resolutions. That way, you can provide additional training for staff, where necessary.

### Customize data fields

Every business is different. If you maintain vehicles, your maintenance requests will differ greatly from a business that maintains real estate. As such, it’s crucial that you gather the right information for your real-world needs.

With Budibase, you have total control over the fields in your maintenance request form.

Our template is fully customizable. You have the power to add the fields you need, including device drop-downs, contact preferences, and even scheduling.

### Automate communications

Our template is built to simplify communications. Eliminate the need for users to call your customer service lines. With our template, they can make instant maintenance requests, anywhere, at any time.

Add your SMTP credentials, and trigger email automations from within your maintenance request app. Use Budibase’s integration options to connect directly to CRMs, softphones, and more.

Budibase also offers full support for instant messaging tools, like Slack. Automatically notify service agents when new maintenance requests are assigned to them.

### Access control

Different kinds of users interact with maintenance request forms differently. You might have individual clients’ employees and managers, internal team members, and IT staff as users on your platform.

Naturally, each of these kinds of users needs to access different features on your form.

With Budibase, you have complete control over how different users access your tools. Our template offers four permission tiers, with complete scope for customization.

### Intuitive UI

Many of your equipment users will lack technical expertise. As such, it’s crucial to offer a form that adequately gathers the information you need to carry out maintenance work.

Our maintenance request form template is designed to offer maximum usability, even for users with poor technical knowledge or digital literacy.

Data fields are presented in clear, simple language, guiding users to provide the exact details your team needs.

### Add conditionality

Our template offers built-in design conditionality. Use conditional UIs to display only relevant data fields to users. If you manage different types of equipment, you can tailor individual forms, depending on the class of item or issue.

For example, you might offer additional data fields for certain devices, or if users choose a particular type of maintenance.

Conditionality improves user experiences and data gathering, by more effectively guiding users through the request process.
