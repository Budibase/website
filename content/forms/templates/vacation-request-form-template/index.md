Time off can be a challenge. Without the right processes, it’s easy for disruptions and miscommunication to occur. Even so, many businesses still manage vacation requests manually, with emails, instant messages, and calendar reminders.

With our vacation request form, you can quickly build a deployable app to manage leave requests. Save time and simplify processes with a secure, effective, and free leave management tool.

## What is a digital vacation request form?

Digital forms are used to simplify admin tasks. Essentially, they allow your employees to quickly submit their vacation requests, whenever and wherever they want. Line managers can then approve or decline requests at the press of a button.

Our vacation request form template takes the grunt work out of managing time off. Don’t waste time on manual vacation requests. Our template allows you to fully automate your business’ leave management process.

### How do digital forms work?

Effective [digital forms](https://budibase.com/forms) have two components. First, there’s a front-end interface, where employees can submit data. Second, there’s a back-end database, where managers can access and manage requests.

In other words, digital forms are simple apps for automating common admin tasks.

### Why do you need a paperless vacation request form?

There are a number of ways to manage vacation requests. Some businesses do this manually, using calendar apps or spreadsheets. This wastes time and opens the door for human error.

Others pay for expensive HR software and only use it for one function.

With our vacation request form template, you can quickly deploy a leave management app. Automate key processes, without the need for a costly HR platform.

Many businesses don’t have a central vacation request resource. Individual line managers are responsible for their own teams. As your business grows, this will start to cause problems. Disorganization leads to business disruption.

Our template allows you to centralize vacation requests across your entire company. Give managers and HR staff complete oversight over all vacation requests. Say goodbye to resourcing issues and skeleton teams.

### Customize data fields

Out of the box, our template uses a range of common data fields. These include personal details, and information relating to leave requests. With Budibase, you have complete control over your vacation request requirements.

Everyone needs a break, but time off also disrupts your business. Integrate your vacation requests with handover processes, by adding fields for employees to detail their current workload.

Budibase forms support digital attachments. Users can submit supporting evidence, like appointment letters or doctor’s notes for sick leave.

### Automated notifications

Connect your employee vacation request form to your internal communication channels. Trigger email automations from any action in the Budibase app. Use automations to notify users of changes to their vacation requests.

Budibase integrates fully with a range of different communication channels, including common IM platforms, like Slack. We also offer a full range of other integrations using Webhooks and Zapier.

### Add conditionality

Tailor your user experiences with conditionality. Depending on users’ roles, departments, actions, or permission levels, you can show different design elements. Conditionality can be added to any field, to create bespoke forms for different types of leave.

For example, you might display handover fields for users who book more than a day’s leave. You can then hide these elements for shorter periods of leave.

Budibase’s conditionality features give you the power to offer a fully tailored user experience.

### Instant requests and approval

Our vacation request form offers maximum efficiency. Employees can request leave in seconds, without the need to book a call with their line manager. Our template offers approval app functionality, so admins can manage requests at the press of a button.

Use automations to determine leave request rules. Instantly approve or decline vacation requests which meet your own internal rules, such as resourcing or cover needs.

With Budibase’s built-in integrations, employees can be instantly notified when their vacation request is approved or denied.

### Tailored access and permissions

Maximize security and usability with tiered permissions. Out of the box, our vacation request template offers four levels of access.

_Basic_ users can access our form and request leave. Line managers and HR employees can be granted _Power_ or _Admin_ permissions, to view, manage, and approve leave requests.

With Budibase, you have total control over user permissions. For example, you might choose to add additional access tiers to reflect a more complex organization. Additional data fields in the user table allow you to limit line managers’ access to their own department’s requests.
