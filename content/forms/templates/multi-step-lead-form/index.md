Collecting data online is critical to many processes, including; customer feedback, lead generation, order intakes, feedback surveys, evaluations, and many more. This specific form template is for capturing leads online.

## What is a multi-step lead form

A multi-step lead form allows you to capture leads online. For example, if a potential customer visits your website, reads the content, and is interested in what they see. The next step is for them to click a call-to-action button (Contact us button), and complete a form expressing their interest and provide you with information re their current circumstances.

From your perspective, you now have a new lead, their contact information, and further context around why they’re interested in your offering.

And what’s great about this lead capture form, is it’s beautifully designed so potential customers are more likely to complete it and submit their information. On top of that, you can automate notifications, so when leads do complete the form, you get an email - and contact them quicker. You can also automate an email to go to the new lead - ‘Hey, thanks for your enquiry…’ And, to go one step further, the users' data will go into an admin panel where you can view their details, and update their records with notes, etc. There’s even a dashboard to help you analyze your new leads!

## What’s included in this lead capture form

### Public multi-step form

Anyone can access the public lead capture form. The form is a multi-step form, which means, the form is divided into multiple sections - 1 question per screen. This provides a better experience for the user. It also gives you more room to dive deeper into each question or show images, videos, etc. The form has a beautiful background that you can customize. It also has built-in conditional logic, which changes the text and button variant when the user is on certain steps.

### Private admin panel

The admin panel is a simple interface for viewing and updating incoming leads. It also comes with two charts which illustrate the total number of leads grouped by size and department. The admin panel is fully responsive and works across all devices.
