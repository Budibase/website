Managing recurring payments presents several challenges. On the one hand, there’s the need to store customers’ data securely. On the other, it’s critical to offer an effective customer experience, to maximize conversions.

More and more businesses are utilizing recurring payments. Customers and companies alike are turning to subscription-based models. This creates the need to gather, store and process recurring payments.

## What is a recurring credit card authorization form?

A digital credit card authorization form is a simple interface, which collects the data needed for recurring payments. This simplifies the process of organizing payments.

### How do digital forms work?

Our digital credit card authorization form has two components:

1. An interface for submitting payment details,
2. A database for storing, managing, and using payment information.

When a user completes our recurring credit card authorization form, their information is entered into the database. This data can then be exported or sent directly to other payment processing tools.

Importantly, a digital payment authorization form should also let users make informed consent. This means clearly stating the terms of the recurring payment, and giving users a choice of whether or not to consent.

### Why manage recurring payments digitally?

Many businesses still manage recurring payments using paper forms. Naturally, this creates inefficiencies. Digital credit card authorization forms increase security while reducing the need for admin time.

Gathering customer information digitally also allows you to automate key elements of payment processing. By building a digital repository of payment information, you’ll be able to automate key tasks, either internally, or with integrations.

### Add conditionality

Add flexibility and functionality to your digital forms with conditional UIs. Display or hide any design element, based on user information, form data, or behavior. Conditionality allows you to create tailored user experiences, within a single form.

For example, you might present different data fields to B2B and B2C customers.

Conditionality also allows you to display different consent notices to users in different locations, ensuring compliance.

### Control access

Access control is critical for data protection. With Budibase, you have complete control over how different users access your app. As standard, Budibase offers four permission tiers, with access to different data and functionality.

Public users can complete the recurring credit card authorization form. Only users with higher permissions can view, edit, or manage data.

This provides customers with the functionality they need to set up recurring payments while protecting them from unauthorized access.
