Cyber security is critical for modern businesses. Reporting IT incidents helps you to mitigate their impact, and prevent future issues. Even so, many businesses don’t have a reporting process in place.

With our incident report template, you can quickly build a platform to manage reporting. A central record of all IT incidents is the first step to securing your business. Our form is designed to maximize employee input.

## What is an IT incident report form?

An IT incident report form is a simple tool for employees to record incidents. These can include cyberattacks, service disruption, or hardware issues. Effective incident report forms ensure quick, thorough, and consistent reporting.

Our incident report form template offers a quick and easy way for employees to record issues. Gain complete oversight over all IT incidents with our simple and intuitive form template.

### Why do you need an IT incident report form?

Even with robust systems in place, things can go wrong. IT incidents often stem from human error, but they can result from many other causes. An incident report form is crucial to record, manage and prevent these issues.

Still, many businesses don’t have an incident reporting system in place. When incidents occur, employees then have to report them manually. This leads to most issues going unreported.

Our IT incident report template prevents this.

### What should an IT incident report include?

IT incident reports are used to thoroughly record the details of an incident. This includes giving a chronological account of what happened, what the impact was, and trying to establish a cause.

Reports should also identify who or what was affected by the incident, and a corrective action plan.

When writing an incident report, most businesses follow a simple format. This includes descriptions and key details of incidents. With our simple incident report form, users can simply input key details to create a thorough record of the incident.

## Our IT incident report template

Our IT incident report template uses a simple form to create an effective record, in seconds. Give your employees a quick and easy way to report IT incidents.

Out of the box, our template offers:

* Custom databases.
* Searchability.
* Automations.
* Intuitive UI.
* Access control.
* Custom data fields.
* Responsive design.
* Flexible hosting.
* Design customization.
* Streamlined processes.

### Reporting and incident management

Incident reporting is crucial. Having a central record of all IT incidents helps you to identify threats, and prevent future damage. However, this only works if your employees actually report incidents.

Our IT incident report formats key information about the incident and affected systems in a clear, concise manner. When an incident occurs, any employee can note the required details in seconds.

We’ve also added an additional form, for IT workers to qualify and respond to incidents. On a separate record, your IT team can assign actions, incident severity, or escalate each case.

### Customize report fields

Every organization is different. Your ICT incident report form must match the information you actually need. With a Budibase form, you have complete control over which data fields to include.

The Budibase builder makes it a breeze to add, edit, or remove form fields.

Our template is designed for quick deployment. We’ve provided the most common fields for effective incident reports. These include descriptive elements, as well as categorization fields and taxonomies. Users can even add supporting evidence and documents to help with formulating incident responses.

### Automate workflows

Our ICT incident report template is built to simplify internal processes. When IT incidents occur, communication is key. The sooner your IT team receives your incident reports, the better.

With Budibase, any in-app action can trigger our vast library of automations.

Notify your IT team when a new incident is reported. With Budibase’s range of integrations, you can even trigger specific responses for different classes of incidents, including internal messaging, tracking tools, or even social media.

### Organize and classify incidents

There is a wide range of different kinds of IT incidents. As such, it’s critical to accurately classify incidents, as they’re reported. Out of the box, our template offers data fields for incident categories and severity rates.

Optimize internal processes by classifying incidents based on required actions. Our template also includes data fields on incident resolution, giving oversight of which incidents still pose a threat.

With Budibase, you have complete control to organize and classify incidents as you see fit.

### Streamline processes

Clear delegation is crucial when responding to IT incidents. The right team members must be assigned to respond to different incidents. This improves response times and internal learning.

Our IT incident report template helps to streamline processes.

Whether you want to divide incident categories into different workflows, or simply oversee responses, Budibase creates fast, effective internal processes.

### Tailored permissions

Different teams use incident records differently. Most employees only need the ability to report incidents. IT teams must then be able to access, edit, and take action based on these initial reports.

Our template features four permission tiers. _Basic_ users can access the initial form, and report incidents. _Power_ and _admin_ users can then view all reports, and access an additional form for responding to initial reports.

With Budibase, you have complete control to add and remove permission tiers as you see fit.

### Design and usability

An incident report form is only as good as the information it gathers. We’ve designed our template for optimal data gathering. Our form offers an intuitive UX, with descriptive fields to prompt users to give the right information.

The goal is to maximize employee adoption.

Don’t bog your employees down with endless paperwork. Instead, give them a clean, usable form, which will encourage them to report IT incidents.

### Conditionality

Our template offers conditionality based on user class, front-end data, and in-app actions. That way, you can offer a perfectly tailored user experience. For example, you might want to alter your form for different types of incidents.

You need different information for data breaches and service outages, for example.

With conditionality in Budibase, you can quickly transform simple forms into flexible and deployable data gathering apps.
