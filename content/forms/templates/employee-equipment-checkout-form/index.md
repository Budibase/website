In the age of remote working, the need to manage how and when employees use devices has increased. Managing devices requires strong and efficient organization, communications, and workflows.

This has become even more important, with the rise of COVID-19. Today, organizations need to sanitize shared devices between uses. Planning for this naturally requires additional time and organization.

Without the right processes in place, it’s almost impossible to manage equipment borrowing. This quickly leads to miscommunications, disruptions, and increased operating costs. Equipment checkout forms help to avoid this.

## What is an employee equipment checkout form?

An employee equipment checkout form is a simple app for managing rentals and borrowing. Essentially, this is a basic interface where users can make requests for equipment checkouts.

The goal is to improve communication, efficiency, and accountability. Users can make equipment requests in seconds, without the need to speak to the responsible teams. This also creates an effective audit trail of who had which devices and when.

### How do digital forms work?

Like all [digital forms](https://budibase.com/forms), an equipment checkout tool has two components:

1. A front-end interface for submitting requests,
2. A back-end database for storing, approving, and managing requests.

When a user makes an equipment rental request, a new row is created in the database. Typically, this details the employee’s name, the equipment they need, when they need it, and any other relevant information.

This database is then used by IT and operations teams, to manage and approve equipment requests. Depending on your needs, this might be done automatically, or manually. The database also provides a record of how and when devices are used.

### Why do you need an employee checkout form app?

For modern businesses, efficiency is everything. Sharing equipment across teams poses a real challenge here. An equipment checkout form app allows you to provide a smoother and more effective process for employees.

For example, multiple employees might need to use the same piece of equipment, at the same time. Staff members who can’t access the right tools straight away will have to wait, disrupting their workflows.

If this only happens occasionally, checkout forms help you to make a decision on who gets priority. If it happens more frequently, checkout form data helps your team to make decisions about procuring additional devices, to improve operations.

## Our employee equipment checkout form template

Our employee equipment checkout template is built for efficiency and functionality.

With our free template, you’ll have access to:

* Connection to external databases.
* Limitless customization.
* Automated emails.
* Intuitive UI.
* Tiered permissions.
* Third-party integrations.
* Responsive design.
* Optional self-hosting.
* Design customization.
* Streamlined workflows.

In minutes, you can create a fully functional employee equipment checkout form. Our template can be deployed either as a standalone app or as a form interface for an existing dataset.

### Streamlined device management

Our equipment checkout form is designed for optimal employee experiences. We’ve provided data fields on employee information, the checkout request, and a long-form text field to provide additional information.

As employees request equipment checkouts, a record is created in your database. This allows your team to manage device rentals, in line with your internal processes.

With Budibase, you have full control and oversight of how employees check out equipment. Build your perfect equipment checkout form around your existing internal processes, creating streamlined workflows.

### Instant request and approval

Employee equipment checkout forms are a powerful way to save time and cut costs. Without a digital system in place, employees are forced to take calls or meetings to organize equipment rental.

This causes unnecessary delays and inefficiencies.

Our form template allows employees to request, manage, and approve equipment checkouts in seconds. You can even set automatic rules, to approve equipment rentals instantly, if a certain device is available.

### Manage communications

Digital forms provide seamless communications. When an employee makes an equipment request, responsible teams can be automatically notified, with any required actions outlined. When a request is approved or declined, the original user can then be notified.

Add SMTP credentials to automate emails within your digital form app.

Budibase also offers integration with a number of softphones and instant messaging apps, including Slack. Our employee equipment checkout form is a simple way to massively improve internal communications.

### Automate workflows

Our template is built to automate equipment checkout workflows. Automations can be triggered from any in-app action. Configure your form to trigger any of our built-in automations, to query, manipulate, and use datasets.

Set rules to automatically assign actions to your device management team. Our built-in JavaScript editor makes it quick and easy to add extra functionality.

Budibase also offers a range of third-party integrations, through Zapier and Webhooks. Use in-app actions to trigger automations in your existing software stack.

### Control access

Use tiered access to create efficient and secure workflows. Our template comes with four permission tiers. _Basic_ users have the ability to check out equipment or view and manage their previous requests.

Users with higher permissions can then manage and approve all requests, or edit and add new users.

This ensures that users have access to the exact data and functionality they need. Effective access control with Budibase provides a clean user experience while maximizing data security.

### Add conditionality

Add conditionality to our template for maximum functionality. Use behavior, user information, or device data to hide or display design elements. Set rules to only display available timeslots for different equipment requests.

You can also display different data fields, depending on the data users provide. For example, you might require additional details to check out certain devices. This allows you to maintain an effective form UI while collecting more in-depth information.

Conditionality can also be used to only offer certain devices to different users. For example, technical and creative teams often have very different equipment requirements. Conditionality offers superior user experiences.

### Digital form design and UI

Our equipment checkout form template is built for maximum usability, even for users with poor digital skills. Data fields are clearly laid out and labeled, ensuring that users provide the exact right information for their requests.

Budibase offers complete customization over your form design. Add, remove, or edit data fields in seconds.

Our template offers a choice of four design themes, with full control over branding and color schemes. Create deployable, branded digital forms in seconds, with our low-code builder.
