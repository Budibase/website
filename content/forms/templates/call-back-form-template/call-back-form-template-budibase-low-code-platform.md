Your customers and clients are busy. Forcing them to wait in lengthy call queues is a guaranteed path to poor customer experiences. This quickly leads to poor satisfaction, and eventually lost revenue.

With our call-back form template, you can quickly build a simple, deployable app. Empower customers to speak with your team at a date and time which suits them.

## What is a call-back form?

A call-back form is a simple interface, which allows users to book a call with your team. Users can choose the date and time which suits them best, provide their contact details, and describe their query.

This provides superior customer experiences, as users can take calls at a time which suits them. Providing information in advance also eliminates the need for customers to explain their queries to multiple service agents.

### How do digital forms work?

[Digital forms](https://budibase.com/forms) have two key components.

1. A front-end interface where users can submit information.
2. A back-end database where this information is stored, managed, and used.

When a user completes your call-back form, a new row is created in your database. That way, the request can be properly actioned. For example, you might configure your form to automatically assign the right service agent, based on availability and expertise.

Online forms are commonly used across websites, apps, and other interaction channels. The key to using contact forms effectively is creating a central dataset to streamline customer service workflows.

### Why do you need a call-back form app?

Customer experience is a key decision factor for many buyers. Whether they want to book a demo, query an order, or access technical help, how your business interacts with customers can have a real impact on revenues.

Call-back forms allow your customers to get in touch, without waiting on the phone.

Many companies use basic HTML forms on their websites to book calls. This can be sufficient for small businesses, but functionality is very limited. As businesses grow, they quickly need more sophisticated solutions.

Build a call-back form app that perfectly matches your internal processes. Use our template as a standalone web app, or as a contact feature within an existing platform.

### Improve customer experiences

Our form template is designed for seamless customer experiences. The preset data fields include contact details, information on their query, and when they’d like to be contacted.

Collect email addresses to manage communications if a customer misses their scheduled call.

With Budibase, you’re in control of how users book calls. Our template is configured to give the option of morning, afternoon, or evening bookings. You can choose to offer more or less granular booking slots, depending on your resourcing needs.

### Manage communications

Our template empowers you to fully manage customer communications. We’ve included a drop-down for users to select the category of their query. There’s also a long-form text box for users to provide background.

Use this information to categorize queries, and assign agents with the right skill set to handle them.

Use our range of integrations to connect your contact form directly to your CRM or softphone, for seamless relationship management workflows.

### Customize data fields

Our call-back form template is fully customizable. You have complete flexibility to add, remove, or edit data fields as you see fit. With Budibase, it’s easy to arm your customer service staff with the exact information they need.

For example, you might choose to gather additional data on user queries relating to sales inquiries, or tech support tickets.

The data fields you provide naturally depend on the type of customer interaction. For example, a sales inquiry form should be as concise as possible to maximize conversion rates. Call-back forms for existing customers can be more in-depth, providing more information for agents.

### Assign agents

Budibase makes it easy to use binding variables and relationships across different data tables. Sort, manipulate, and query data on your user table using inputs from your customer-facing contact form.

This makes automatically assigning the right agent to each call a breeze.

Use our range of third-party app integrations to add call requests to your agents’ calendars or other contact center tools.

### Automate workflows

Use any action in our template to trigger Budibase’s library of built-in automations. Add SMTP credentials to trigger automated emails, or use data connectors to update external records.

Budibase offers third-party integrations with Zapier, Webhooks, and more. Use in-app actions to trigger automations in your existing software stack.

Our platform also provides a built-in JavaScript editor, making it quick and easy to add extra functionality.

### Conditional UI

Create streamlined conditional interfaces with the Budibase editor. With conditionality, you can hide or display any designed element, based on user data and actions. This means you can use a single form, but only display data fields that are relevant to the user’s query.

Alternatively, you might choose to use truncated or multi-step forms for users on mobile devices.

At Budibase, we provide simple and effective design tools, to create the perfect interface for your users.

### Access control

Budibase offers flexible permissions and access control. Access control is crucial for maintaining security in customer-facing apps. Assign permissions to control which functions different users can access.

Our template features four permission tiers, for _public, basic, power,_ and _admin_ users.

That way, customers can use your call-back form. Service agents, line managers, and admins can then access the exact data and functionality they need in their roles.

### Design and usability

Our call-back form template is designed for maximum usability. Our clean and intuitive form features clear and descriptive labels. This ensures that users provide the exact information your agents need to handle their queries.

Choose from one of Budibase’s four built-in app themes to create your perfect design. With our low-code app builder, you can add branding or alter color schemes in seconds.

All Budibase apps are fully mobile responsive, and test for accessibility.
