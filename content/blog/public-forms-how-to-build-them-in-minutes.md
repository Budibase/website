# What is a public form

A public form is a digital form that is accessible to anyone on the internet.

## Public form examples

There are many examples where a user may want to create a public form. I've listed a few of these scenarios below:

1\. A public survey

2\. Log in form

3\. Sign up form

4\. Contact form

5\. Application form

6\. Information request form

7\. A COVID test response form

## Public vs. Private form

The only difference between a public and private form is the access level. Public forms are accessible to anyone across the internet. Private forms are accessible to predefined users behind a log-in.

# Form types

There are many styles of forms, but broadly speaking, they can be pigeonholed into the following two categories:

## Single-step forms

If you think of a form, this is probably what you picture. A simple, vertical flowing form that spans one screen, usually with a submit button. These types of forms are perfect, when your form consists of a few simple inputs - as a rule of thumb, if you have more than 6 inputs, you should consider a multi-step form.

### Examples of single-step forms

### How to build a public form (single-step)

Both Budibase and Google Forms are great options for building a public form (single-step). Google Forms is free, proprietary software. The data submitted within your form is hosted with Google. On the other hand, Budibase is free and open-source; therefore, it's possible to self-host Budibase and keeps the data in the safety of your infrastructure.

## Multi-step forms

Multi-step forms are forms that span across multiple screens. They are also known as stepper forms and generally consist of 1 or 2 questions per screen. Multi-step forms are great when you've got a lot of inputs within your form or when you need to add media/explanations to questions.
