A good database is crucial to any company.  An organization's database stores all the pertinent details about the company, such as employee details, client records, transactional information, etc. Therefore selecting the correct database is critical. The database selection process can be complex, especially if you're inexperienced. Fortunately, we're made the process easier for you. We've compiled a list of the 14 best database management software to use in 2021. You can find the list below, and we've also covered important topics to help with comprehension of the subject.  

## What is a database?

As we live a large part of our lives on computers and the internet, we create vast amounts of data. For example, the words on this page are data. But for these words to exist, they must be stored somewhere - and that somewhere is a database. 

> A database stores and organizes data so information is easily accessed, managed, and updated.

## What is database management software, and what are they used for?

Database management software, also known as DBMS software, is the interface between you, the user, and the data. As a user, you use a DBMS to store, manage, and update data and control access in a database environment. Database management systems vary, and there are several different types which we will cover later, but most of them include; a data library, auditing, data abstraction, security, and recovery support.

## Types of database management systems

Database management systems come in several different types, each with its strengths and weaknesses. You don't need to try all these types. You need to figure out which one works best for your business. To help you, I've added an explanation for each type below: 

- **Relational -** Relational database management systems (RDBMS) organize and store data in tables. These tables are linked together - which is where the term relational derives from (relationships between data/tables). Tables consist of fields (think table columns) and records (think table rows). SQL is the standard language for this type of database.
- **Document -** Document store or document-orientated database systems are schema-less, which means they do not have a uniform structure, such as a table. This is why people refer to these types of databases as non-relational or NoSQL. Within NoSQL databases, columns can contain arrays (multiple values), and records can be nested.
- **Key-value -** Key-value stores are simple in nature and consist of keys and values. Every single item within a key-value store is given a key and value. Due to its simplicity, this type of database is not great for complex data structures. However, they are well suited to use cases such as embedded systems. 
- **Search engine -** Search engines are NoSQL databases dedicated to search. As the amount of data we collect increases, so does the need for performant search capabilities. Apache Lucene is a critical player in a number of the best search engines available.
- **Wide-column -** Wide-column stores utilize a similar structure to a relational database: tables, columns, and rows. But there is a critical difference: wide-column stores structure their data around columns rather than rows.
- **Graph -** Graph databases use graph structures to store and sort information. These structures consist of nodes and relationships. Within this type of database, relationships are treated equally important as the data itself. If your application heavily revolves around relationships, such as social networks, this may be a good choice.
- **Time Series -** As you can probably guess, this type of database is optimized for time series data (time-stamped records). Examples of applications that might use a time-series database are a wall street trading application, a smart home monitor, and a Covid Infection Rate application.

I have not covered additional database types, such as Multivalue database management systems and Object-Oriented database management systems. In both the cases above, relational databases have been extended to cover some of the features offered.

If after reading the above you are still not sure what database management system to choose, read the following three tips:

1. How much data are you storing? Different databases perform differently with varying amounts of data. Some databases will not serve you well if you have petabytes of data, for example. Also, when considering this, think of the future and how the databases scale.
2. A data modeling exercise will guide your decision. There are several different approaches to data modeling, but primarily you should consider the entities in your data model and what values are stored for each entity. I would advise you to draw an ERD (entity-relationship diagram).
3. You can use more than one database management system, for example, a Document Store with a Search Engine.

## 14 best database management software examples

Below, I have listed my 14 best DBMS examples. Some examples support multiple types of models, but I have grouped them according to what I feel is their primary model type. For those of you who are considering building a web app / internal tool, I have also outlined whether the listed database is supported by [Budibase](https://www.budibase.com) - an open source development platform for building internal tools in minutes. If it is supported by Budibase, you can simply connect that database and build anything from dashboards, admin panels to approval applications in minutes.

#### 3. MySQL

{{< figure src="/best-database-management-software/mysql.png" alt="mysql logo">}} 

MySQL is another database from Oracle, but this one is free and open-source. Historically, I always associated MySQL for its speed and simplicity. In recent versions, the creators changed the engine, adding additional functionality and the detriment of speed. These additional features are essential for enterprise clients and include transactions and key constraints. MySQL was my go-to relational DB, but I've since moved to PostgreSQL due to its handling of concurrency.

The database system supports three data models with one database core and a unified query language AQL. The query language is declarative and allows the combination of different data access patterns in a single query. Neo4j was the graph DB of choice for so long, but ArangoDB is now my go-to choice for the reasons below.

- USP - Data relationships are natively stored as first-class citizens as a graph edge
- Pro - Performant with highly connected datasets
- Con - Switching graph stores can be complex due to poor query standards
- When would I use this - When relationships are a critical component of my data architecture - social networks, for example.
- Secondary models - document store, key-value store, search engine
- License - Open Source
- Supported by Budibase - Yes

#### 13. Neo4j

{{< figure src="/best-database-management-software/neo4j.png" alt="Neo4j logo">}} 

Neo4j is a native graph database built from the ground up to leverage data and data relationships. It is the largest graph database ecosystem with more than 15 million downloads, and Docker pulls. It is also one of the oldest and is more well-known than Arangodb.

- USP - Robust graph visualization tools
- Pro - Graph edges can store labels
- Con - You can only have one Graph per Neo4j instance
- When would I use this - Until I experienced Arangodb, I would have chosen Neo4j without thinking. Now, I would select Arangodb due to its feature-rich platform. I suppose I would choose Neo4j if I heavily relied on Spring.
