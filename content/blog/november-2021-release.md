In November, Budibase launched out of beta! The response from our community was amazing, and over 5000 new accounts signed up to Budibase. If this wasn’t enough, we’ve found time to release a number of new features:

## Budibase Blocks

Blocks are predefined sets of components that streamline the design process within Budibase. Before blocks, creating a list of searchable cards took 10 minutes; with blocks, this process takes under 1 minute.

## Oracle DB Integration

A popular request amongst our community, we’re happy to announce you can now use Oracle DB to build business apps with Budibase. Going one step further, we’ve made the Oracle datasource a ‘Datasource Plus’ which allows you to generate tables directly from your Oracle database.

***

## MSSQL Datasource Plus

Building on our MSSQL integration, you can now generate tables directly from your MSSQL database.

***

## New Screen Creation UI

Autogenerate CRUD screens from any datasource with just a few clicks. The new UI and UX stems from numerous conversations with the community and makes the design experience consistent between the internal database and external datasources.

## Filter Component

You can now include a dynamic filter component inside a data provider and have complete control over all of the filters - automatically. Users can now create incredible search and filtering experiences with just a few clicks.

## Add text directly to the design screen

Type directly onto your design screen instead of using the settings panel. For simple text input, we feel this is a better experience.
