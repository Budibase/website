AI form builders have exploded in popularity over the past couple of years, offering a fast, easy way to output working data collection tools.

Because of this, we now have a huge number of AI form generators to choose from, including from most of the big names in the form builder space more broadly.

However, it’s also important to note that this comes as part of a wider rush for SaaS brands to implement AI functionality. This means that the actual quality and usefulness of specific tools can vary quite widely.

In this second part of our guide to AI forms, we’re diving deep into the market for AI form builders. 

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What is an AI form builder?](#what-is-an-ai-form-builder)
- [Why use an AI form generator?](#why-use-an-ai-form-generator)
- [What to look for in an AI form builder](#what-to-look-for-in-an-ai-form-builder)
- [6 AI form builders for 2025](#6-ai-form-builders-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is an AI form builder?

As the name suggests, AI form builders are platforms that leverage LLMs to help us build data collection UIs more quickly and easily.

This can work in a few different ways, but the most common is allowing us to generate forms from a natural language input. 

For example, we could ask for a `contact us` or `change request` form. The form generator would then determine the required data schema for this, before placing it into a working UI within its own builder.

Most of the big-name form builder tools now offer this within their platform, and often embedded on their website as a lead magnet too. The goal is to make it faster and easier to output a working solution, or at least a basic version of one.

In most cases, forms will still require some element of customization within the wider form builder, including modifying the generated data model or tweaking the design.

Besides straight-up generation, many form builders offer more advanced AI-powered functionality.

This comes in a few distinct categories:

- **Builder enhancements** - For example, copilot-style tips, or suggestions for new questions and other changes to our forms.
- **AI-driven workflows** - Enabling us to trigger workflow automations that involve AI operations on form submissions.
- **Handling form responses** - AI tools to help us analyze form responses and extract insights from data.

Naturally, which of these we prioritize will vary depending on our specific use cases. For example, AI-driven analytics tools are probably only helpful for high-volume forms, whereas AI-driven workflows are increasingly a critical part of a huge range of internal applications.

## Why use an AI form generator?

Now that we have a better grasp of what AI form generators are and what they offer, it’s also worth considering the concrete benefits and other practical considerations in more detail.

As we hinted at already, the core value-add here is enabling us to build forms more quickly and easily. To understand this better, it’s useful to consider the broader experience of teams that need to output custom forms.

This is about the most repetitive internal development task there is. That is, in just about every industry, teams are tasked with outputting huge numbers of forms, across a variety of different workflows.

Depending on the complexity of individual use cases, this is typically handled by IT teams using a low-code platform, or by colleagues in the relevant department using a no-code form builder, although some highly advanced use cases might be hard-coded.

At their core, AI form generators seek to expedite this process by reducing the initial lift required to output a solution.

Similarly, where individual platforms offer additional capabilities, like AI-driven workflow automations or data analysis, the goal is ultimately the same.

That is, providing AI-powered experiences for tasks that would otherwise require more extensive human-led actions to perform, empowering technical and non-technical colleagues to do these more quickly and easily.

### Potential drawbacks

However, before we start thinking about how we can choose specific AI form builder platforms, it’s also important to be realistic about some of the potential limitations, challenges, and downsides of this type of form building.

One key element to be aware of is that, often, the more specific our requirements are, the less likely AI generation is to be the right approach.

For instance, if we already know the exact fields we’d like to include in a form, the likelihood is that it would actually be faster and easier to build this manually in whichever platform we select, rather than going down the route of AI generation.

Similarly, many dedicated form builders are highly opinionated, including in terms of design, data modelling, and other aspects of our form solutions. As such, for less straightforward use cases, after AI generating a form, there might not be sufficient scope for customization.

One important aspect of this is the fact that most off-the-shelf form builders are limited in terms of the data types they support. Most only offer a built-in database, with no support for editing the schema of this independently of our form UI.

This won’t be viable if we have more sophisticated data modelling needs, or want to connect to an existing SQL database or API endpoint.

At the same time, many form builders prioritize the speed with which we can output professional UIs, at the expense of customization or flexibility. 

Lastly, AI form builders raise some important security questions. Most often, platforms don’t offer the flexibility to choose which LLM we rely on or how our data is shared with it. This could naturally be problematic for many teams.

## What to look for in an AI form builder

Before we check out some of the specific platforms that are available on the market today, we’re going to outline some of the key decision points that we’re going to encounter along the way. In other words, what factors can we use to determine which platform best suits our needs?

As with any software procurement decision, this draws in a range of interrelated issues, including:

- **Pricing** - How much the platform will cost to use.
- **License structure** - The pricing model that this is based on, including any usage or feature restrictions across individual tiers.
- **Design flexibility and customization** - Our requirements around the form UIs we can create, for instance, adding custom code, building mobile-friendly forms, or utilizing conditionality rules.
- **Data modelling requirements** - Including in terms of our data schema and the specific database tools that underpin this.
- **Data residency, security, and compliance** - The specific security and compliance controls on offer, as well as our options around how and where our data is stored.
- **Integration options** - The extent to which an AI form builder can integrate with our wider tool stack.
- **Automation tools** - How easily we can implement automation logic based on form submissions, as well as the complexity of the solutions we can build.
- **AI-specific considerations** - Including flexibility around utilizing different LLMs, as well as working with custom prompts and operations.
- **Enterprise functionality** - Capabilities that are required in large organizations, such as SSO, self-hosting, air-gapped deployments, audit logs, and more.

The important thing to understand, however, is that the significance of each of these will vary from one team to the next. This can be informed by your target use cases, budget, user personas, and other factors.

So, when considering AI form builders, it’s crucial to have a clear picture of your own specific requirements in order to make an informed decision about which specific platform can offer the most value.
