The IT department is probably the team under the greatest pressure to stay informed. The problem is finding the time. IT teams already have some of the busiest, most varied workloads across the organization. 

How do you carve an hour to get to grips with the latest AI fads when you’ve got a full backlog of tickets to work through?

To try and alleviate this pressure, countless brands run IT newsletters, claiming to give you the key facts in your mailbox. But you still only want to bother with the good ones. Otherwise, you’re back at square one - only with a more chaotic inbox every morning.

Today, we’re cutting through the noise to give you the best publications under a range of IT themes, including

- [General IT newsletters,](#general-it-newsletters)
- [Service management,](#service-management)
- [Tech stacks,](#tech-stacks)
- [Emerging tech,](#emerging-tech)
- [Business management, skills, and industry news.](#business-management-skills-and-industry-news)

## Why subscribe to an IT newsletter?

Or, to put it another way, how do you know if a specific newsletter is worth your time?

The best way to think about this is considering what’s in it for you versus what’s in it for the publisher. 

Every newsletter has a business model of some kind. If it’s a standalone publication, this might be selling ad space to other brands in their niche. If it’s a newsletter run by a broader company, they’re likely focused on boosting the visibility of their own brand.

Neither is a problem in and of itself. 

It’s the specific balance between their interests and yours that matters. So, if you’re actually getting sent insightful, actionable content, that’s great. If you’re just being spammed with webinar links and sponsored content, maybe look elsewhere.

## Top 16 IT newsletters for 2025

Obviously, you’re here because you want recommendations. We’ve curated 16 of our favorite newsletters from across the IT space.

Since this is a hugely varied niche, we’ve split these into five categories to cover the whole span of what you need to know.

### General IT newsletters

First up, we’ve got four broad newsletters covering a wide range of topics across the IT sector.

#### 1. Bandwidth
Bandwidth is Budibase's bi-weekly newsletter for IT professionals. It offers a hand-curated view of the top stories across the world of IT, across new technology, industry trends, soft-skills, key events, and more.

It's aimed at busy teams who need to balance staying informed with keeping the lights on.

Bandwidth also provides wider coverage of the IT space, including important dates for the diary, community news, and insights on the state of the industry.   


> 🕒 **Frequency** - Bi-weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Curated, actionable insights for busy IT professionals.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Daily digests, non-IT tech news, hardware-focused newsletters.

#### 2. TLDR Tech

![TLDR IT Newsletter](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766044/cms/it-newsletters/TLDR_Tech_ui5o9q.webp "TLDR IT Newsletter")

TLDR is probably the best-known brand in this space. It’s carved out a niche for itself with its signature, barebones format. Everyday, they publish a curated set of the top stories in the world of tech, startups, and software, as well as their own original content.

This digest-style approach is great if you want an overview of the top trending tech topics each day.

However, other newsletters go into more granular detail on specific themes. TLDR can also be a little light on topics that are most applicable to IT teams in large organizations, casting a broader net for its readership.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Daily & weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - A concise, daily summary of the top tech topics.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - More detailed, actionable insights for enterprise IT teams.

#### 3. IT Brew

![IT Brew](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766043/cms/it-newsletters/IT_Brew_neprii.webp "IT Brew")

As you might gather from the name, IT Brew is the technology arm of the Morning Brew newsletter brand. It’s another daily newsletter, but it takes a slightly different slant compared to TLDR.

For one thing, they primarily publish original journalism rather than syndicating stories. The goal is to inform and engage - with a lighthearted tone that’s not light on details. 

This covers a range of themes that are relevant to enterprise IT teams, including ITOps, security, strategy, data, hardware, and more. On the flip side, since it’s mainly original content, IT Brew’s individual issues can sometimes cover less ground than competitors.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Daily.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Insightful, original stories on key IT topics.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Broader, digest-style editions.

#### 4. Hacker Newsletter

![Hacker Newsletter](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766042/cms/it-newsletters/Hacker_Newsletter_g1kn4l.webp "Hacker Newsletter")

Hacker Newsletter is a weekly hand-curation of the most interesting stories from Hacker News, the ubiquitous message board for people with an interest in tech, startups, and really anything else that piques their curiosity.

Hacker News rewards novel, niche stories. Often, these relate to highly granular development topics, but we’ll also see opinion pieces, product announcements, or the latest scientific research into more disparate topics - like teaching pure mathematics to crows.

As such, Hacker Newsletter is undoubtedly informative, unique, and entertaining. But it can also vary widely in terms of the topics included, so you might not see actionable value from every edition.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Unique takes on a huge range of topics.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - More specific, actionable insights on running an IT team.

### Service management

Next up, we’ve got a selection of IT newsletters that are more focused on the daily grind of delivering internal services.

#### 5. Joe the IT Guy

![Joe the IT Guy](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766042/cms/it-newsletters/Joe_the_IT_Guy_aeoav8.webp "Joe the IT Guy")

Joe the IT Guy is SysAid’s branded ITSM blog. It’s not a standalone newsletter as such, although we can subscribe to have new posts emailed to us directly. Publication can be somewhat sporadic, but generally averages 1-2 articles per month.

Since it’s backed by an enterprise-grade ITSM platform, JtITG provides original, well-research insights on stories on key ITSM and ITL processes, including problem management, asset management, and more.

Despite being a good source of information for underlying IT processes, JtITG typically doesn’t get into more technical detail or explore specific solutions.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Irregular.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Insightful content on ITSM processes.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - A traditional, regularized newsletter.

#### 6. iTSM Group

![ITSM Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766042/cms/it-newsletters/ITSM_Group_xxi4sm.webp "ITSM Group")

iTSM Group is a digital transformation and enterprise service management consultancy. They publish a monthly newsletter that’s firmly aimed at enterprise IT teams, including topics such as emerging technology, regulatory issues, and certifications.

Their content is well-researched and informed, and could be a good option if you’re primarily looking for actionable advice.

However, it also mixes in their own company news. Since they’re also a ServiceNow, they also focus heavily on developments within it as a platform.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Monthly,
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Regulatory topics, enterprise management, ServiceNow content.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Broader industry news, more frequent publication, or content on other solutions.

#### 7. ITSM.Tools

![ITSM.Tools](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766043/cms/it-newsletters/ITSM.Tools_sjrsmx.webp "ITSM.Tools")

ITSM.Tools is an owned brand of another major vendor in this space, ManageEngine. There’s an accompanying newsletter, based around their own original content.

Within the ITSM niche, this is highly focused on ITIL, service desks, and employee management, although they also publish content on more general IT topics.

Again, though, ITSM.Tools is primarily centered around original content, so it might not quite fit the bill if you’re looking for a more general briefing newsletter.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Not fixed.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - ITIL-focused content, service desk management topics.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Syndicated or digest-style content, daily briefings.

### Tech stacks

Next, we can consider some IT newsletters with a specific focus on empowering teams to choose the right tools for their needs.

#### 8. Changelog Weekly

![Changelog Weekly](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766042/cms/it-newsletters/Changelog_Weekly_zycges.webp "Changelog Weekly")

Changelog Weekly is firmly one for the developers. As you can guess from the name, it’s a weekly newsletter. Notably, this also comes out with an accompanying podcast.

It’s specifically focused on the changing face of software development, with recent articles on getting up to speed with Docker, alternatives to React, and AI tech debt.

This is a great resource if you’re heavily development-focused, but it might not be quite the ticket if you’re more focused on general IT or enterprise use cases.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - In-depth, developer-centric topics.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - General IT, service management, enterprise content.

#### 9. Serverless Framework

![Serverless Framework](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766042/cms/it-newsletters/Serverless_Framework_gcfcvw.webp "Serverless Framework")

Serverless Framework is another development-heavy newsletter, this time even more niched down on using serverless technology to create scalable solutions.

So expect a tight focus on deployment, CI/CD, software architecture, testing, and other related topics. While this is a proprietary blog of the Serverless Framework organization, it also mixes in frequent guest posts.

Like Changelog Weekly, Serverless Framework is a great resource for topics within their niche but may be less applicable to more general IT pros.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Not fixed.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Serverless infrastructure and technology.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Content on other aspects of IT.

#### 10. Level Up

![LevelUp](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766041/cms/it-newsletters/LevelUp_otjz8j.webp "LevelUp")

Level Up is a curated newsletter aimed at IT leaders at all levels, including CTOs, technical architects, and IT managers. It’s particularly strong around topics such as engineering, emerging tech, and other industry trends.

This is all mixed in with the personal experience of Level Up’s author, Patrick Kua, who lends a unique perspective to topical stories.

However, it’s worth noting that this may not be the most suitable for readers looking for a broader overview of topics, as Kua tends to primarily share more in-depth content.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - A unique, insightful curation of engineering topics.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - More news-style, digested syndication.

### Emerging tech

One of the areas where IT pros face the most pressure to stay informed is new technology. Unsurprisingly, this is also one of the most popular genres of IT newsletters.

#### 11. The Algorithm

![The Algorithm IT Newsletter](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766039/cms/it-newsletters/The_Algorithm_iwemet.webp "The Algorithm IT Newsletter")

The Algorithm is MIT Tech Review’s weekly AI newsletter. It’s a highly forward looking publication, covering issues relating to policy, governance, and research in the artificial intelligence and machine learning space.

This folds in some more up-to-date industry news syndication, but the bigger focus is on the role of AI in society, alongside the latest academic thinking from both a technical and regulatory point of view.

The Algorithm is an excellent resource for leaders in this space, but may be less relevant for more use-case-specific or directly actionable content for IT teams.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Well-researched content relating to AI policy and developments.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Specific, actionable insights on using AI for specific IT use cases.

#### 12. Future Crunch

![Future Crunch](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766040/cms/it-newsletters/Future_Crunch_uhonwo.webp "Future Crunch")

Future Crunch is a slightly different proposition from most of the other IT newsletters we’ve seen so far. Its mission is to highlight positive stories about how science and technology are improving society.

Naturally, this pulls in emerging technology topics, such as quantum computing, AI, and blockchain. However, these are not the main focus.

So, it’s one that will no doubt be of interest to many IT pros, even if the content itself isn’t always directly relevant to their roles.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Positive news stories covering science, technology, and more.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Content that’s more directly applicable to IT professionals.

#### 13. Import AI

![Import AI](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766039/cms/it-newsletters/Import_AI_lejpvx.webp "Import AI")

Another weekly newsletter, Import AI, is more focused on technical issues than the Algorithm. It’s written by Jack Clark, one of the co-founders of Anthropic, who was previously a policy director at OpenAI and a reporter at Bloomberg.

So, you can expect well-informed, cogent articles on a mixture of AI’s role in society, and more granular technical news, like performance improvements to specific models.

It’s a great choice for readers who are already well-informed about working with AI, but it may be a bit too technically detailed for readers who are less up-to-speed.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Granular, highly technical AI topics.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - More detailed content on using AI for specific use cases.

### Business management, skills, and industry news

Lastly, we have IT newsletters that deal with the wider industry, including the jobs market, economics, and IT’s intersection with other business verticals.

#### 14. LeadDev

![LeadDev](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766039/cms/it-newsletters/LeadDev_yptpwm.webp "LeadDev")

LeadDev is a weekly newsletter aimed at engineering leaders. It distributes the top original stories from the wider LeadDev site, on granular leadership and management skills, as well as resourcing issues like building, scaling, and utilizing engineering teams.

This also ties in original research, webinars, and events, along with more specific career development resources for senior devs.

This can be an invaluable resource for IT professionals who want to develop their soft skills or advance their careers, although it doesn’t typically cover more technical or solution-focused content.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Leadership and management skills for IT professionals.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Solutions-focused or technical content.

#### 15. CIO Center Stage

![CIO](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766040/cms/it-newsletters/CIO_ep0rxb.webp "CIO")

CIO Center Stage is Foundry’s bi-weekly newsletter highlighting their best conversations with IT leaders. In addition to their personal experiences, this is also a useful resource for expert options on topics such as AI adoption, innovation, IT operations, and other industry trends.

The really big benefit is we’re hearing from people with hands-on experience of how to solve key challenges for IT leaders.

On the flip side, IT leaders might not always be in the weeds when it comes to rolling out specific solutions. Additionally, some of what’s included might not be applicable to smaller organizations.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Every other Wednesday.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Hands-on expertise from top IT leaders.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - More practical, on-the-ground stories.

#### 16. Lenny’s Newsletter

![Lenny's](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1738766040/cms/it-newsletters/Lenny_s_d2lmym.webp "Lenny's")

Last up, we have Lenny’s, which is probably the most widely known weekly newsletter for product managers. While not strictly an IT newsletter in the broadest sense, Lenny’s output is popular among non-product roles including solutions, software, and design professionals.

One particular strength is Lenny’s regular features on how household SaaS tools, such as Miro, Coda, and Figma build products, giving us a unique insight into the development process of cutting edge brands.

Lenny’s is also a great source of career information, especially around soft skills for professionals in technical roles.

> 🕒 **Frequency** - Weekly.
>
> ✅ **Great for** - Product development processes and insights.
>
> ❌ **Look elsewhere for** - Coverage of broader IT subjects.
