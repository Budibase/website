+++

IT helpdesk chatbots are possibly the most widespread real-world use case for agentic AI. On the one hand, IT teams face ever-growing demand for services.

On the other, the majority of service interactions are highly repetitive tasks, often requiring fairly basic actions to resolve.

This means that IT support workflows are uniquely well-positioned to benefit from intelligent self-service automation tools.

Today, we’re diving deep into how we can achieve exactly this, including when and where chatbots are used, the benefits they offer, the specific technical considerations we’ll need to keep in mind, and the practical implementation challenges we might face.

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is an IT helpdesk chatbot?

An IT helpdesk chatbot is a conversational system that enables end users to interact with AI-powered service automations, using natural language.

![IT Helpdesk Chatbot](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1760606931/cms/ai-chat-uis/Chat_UI_Better_io94i1.gif "IT helpdesk Chabot")

In other words, rather than utilizing a traditional ticketing platform, they can submit issues to an AI-powered system in much the same way they would communicate with human agents.

The important thing, though, is that an effective helpdesk chatbot doesn’t just respond to users’ queries.

Instead, the idea is to replicate the kinds of tasks and decisions that would otherwise rely on front-line helpdesk colleagues.

To achieve this, chatbots can independently assess context, perform reasoning, and carry out resolution actions within their environment. So, they might be able to solve certain issues automatically, while others will require escalation to a human agent for further assistance.

One way to think about this is that a helpdesk chatbot can supplant our support team for more straightforward or common requests, freeing them up to work on more complex or high-priority issues.

As interactions are conversational, chatbots can also guide end users through the process of submitting the required information, including asking follow-up questions or even embedding structured data UI components, such as forms or drop-downs.

### What does an IT chatbot do?

Understanding what IT chatbots are in broad terms, we can begin to think about the specific kinds of interactions that these can help support.

Lower levels within support teams, primarily L1, spend huge amounts of time processing incoming requests. This includes tasks like triage, categorization, routing, and verifying issues. Where L1 colleagues do resolve issues, these are often related to fairly administrative actions.

For instance, resetting passwords, granting access to resources, or performing other repetitive tasks that don’t necessarily require extensive specialist skills or knowledge. We’ll return to some of these key tasks and use cases a little later.

More complex tasks are escalated to higher tiers of support.

Therefore, what an IT helpdesk chatbot effectively achieves is enabling end users to self-serve on common L1 support issues, without the negative UX impact of funelling users towards a structured self-service portal to access these services.

In other words, we can enable end users to trigger automations to resolve their own issues, while still having an experience akin to interacting with a human agent.

As we’ll see later, this relies on effective integration with tools across our ITSM stack, in order to pull information from relevant knowledge sources and carry out support tasks in a reliable manner.

Additionally, modern chatbot systems are capable of learning from service interactions, allowing them to continuously improve based on the outcomes of issues.

## Why are IT teams leveraging AI chat for support?

Next, we can drill into more detail about the actual concrete benefits of utilizing conversational AI tools within IT helpdesk workflows.

We’ve already hinted at some of the most important issues here. Perhaps more than any other department, IT teams today face a difficult combination of exploding demand for services and static or even shrinking budgets.

In light of this, one of the biggest drivers towards agentic AI for support workflows is the need to build efficiency and cost-effectiveness into our service portfolios.

Obviously, one aspect of this is reducing our reliance on human colleagues for menial or repetitive tasks, freeing them up to work on more complex issues.

Another way to think about this is that, by bringing context awareness and independent reasoning into the picture, agentic systems open up the scope of tasks that can be automated, beyond strictly deterministic workflows.

Besides simple cost/benefit calculations, helpdesk chatbots can have an outsized impact on a range of IT support and service management KPIs.

Notably, by eliminating the need for many common manual tasks, chatbots can be a powerful solution for cutting our average time to resolution - even for interactions that aren’t ultimately resolved by the AI system.

That is, basic issues can be resolved more or less automatically, while more complex ones can be addressed by human colleagues more quickly.

As such, we can also expect a boost for user satisfaction rates, both among IT colleagues and across the wider organization. 

However, it’s important to note that none of these benefits are inevitable. Instead, they depend on us selecting the appropriate solutions and tooling for our specific needs. We’ll return to some of the key decisions we’ll need to make around this a little later. 

## Core use cases

First, though, we can return to the more granular use cases for IT chat tools. More specifically, we want to outline some of the most common tasks that agentic systems can resolve for users within support and service workflows.

One critical aspect to this that we’ve touched on already is initially analyzing tickets, issues, and service requests.

This is particularly important in the context of natural language interactions. That is, enabling users to describe their issues in their own words presents an additional challenge for routing them to the appropriate workflow.

Therefore, one of the key use cases for chatbot systems in support contexts is assessing incoming tickets to triage, categorize, and prioritize them.

Beyond this, we also need to be aware of the types of resolution actions that helpdesk chatbots most frequently take to assist users.

In broad terms, these are repetitive tasks, usually taking the form of:

- **Automating simple fixes** - such as password resets, account unlocks, or permissions changes.
- **Providing guided troubleshooting** - for connectivity or configuration issues through dynamic prompts.
- **Retrieving knowledge-base content** - to answer procedural or “how-to” questions.
- **Triggering workflow automations** - for instance, provisioning access to a shared drive or restarting a virtual machine.
- **Gathering diagnostic data** - like system status, device info, and recent errors, before escalation to higher-tier support.
- **Updating or closing tickets automatically** - once a resolution is confirmed by the user.

This generally utilizes what’s known as [tool calling](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/tool-calling/) to provide AI systems with permitted, rules-based actions that they can trigger, as well as guidance on when they should be used.

## How do IT chatbots work?

Having extensively covered what IT helpdesk chatbots are and what they achieve, we can begin to think in more depth about how this works at a technical level.

This is important even if we don’t plan to build a custom solution from scratch. 

That is, in order to make informed decisions about implementing a solution that matches our own requirements, we’ll need to understand the various parts that chatbots are made of and the role that they play in the wider system.

We can break this into a few key parts.

### Large language models

Modern chatbot solutions are centered around large language models. These are software systems that utilize large collections of data in order to predict and generate text.

This is what enables the chatbots to interpret inputs, generate a response, and determine what actions may be necessary to solve the user’s issue.

The most common LLMs include OpenAI’s GPTs, Google Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude family of models.

However, there’s a huge variation between the different models that are available today. One important consideration here is the model’s `size`. Essentially, this refers to the number of data points that the model is made up of.

All else being equal, we can expect a larger model to produce higher-quality results. But, we’ll also incur higher costs, either in the form of calls to a publicly available service or in terms of infrastructure costs to host a model ourselves.

That leads us to another important consideration - whether or not we can host specific models on our own infrastructure. ITSM is a use case that often has heightened regulatory needs, so many teams won’t want to rely on publicly available models.

Take a look at our guide to [open-source LLMs](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/open-source-llms/) to learn more. 

Additionally, we may need to prioritize task specificity when selecting a model. In some cases, this might mean prioritizing models that have been trained using specialized data, especially when dealing with comparatively small LLMs.

Even across more general models, we’ll still need to pay attention to their respective benchmarking for relevant tasks, as well as the extent to which we can tune them to our target use case.

### Chat UIs

Next, the front-end of our IT helpdesk chatbot tool is naturally critical too. This is where end users can interact with our AI-powered support workflows.

![IT Helpdesk Chatbot](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1760606931/cms/ai-chat-uis/Embedded_Form_djq2qx.gif "IT Helpdesk Chatbot")

At the most basic level, this is made up of a text box for enabling users to send queries to our chatbot, along with an experience for displaying incoming and outgoing messages in real time. Usually, this is takes the form of chat bubbles.

The real-time aspect is what’s most important here. We’ll need an interface that’s capable of `streaming` in order to continuously display new responses from our LLM as and when we receive them.

However, as we know already, IT helpdesk chatbots aren’t only used to generate answers to users’ queries. Instead, they also enable users to self-serve their issues, by triggering defined resolution actions.

For this, we’ll often need more advanced UIs, capable of `component streaming`. This means embedding app components within the chat experience, including forms, tables, or dropdowns. For instance, to gather structured data or seek approval for an automation action.

To learn more, take a look at our guide to [chat UI](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-chat-uis/) design.

### Integration layers

Lastly, helpdesk chatbots are heavily reliant on integrations with our wider ITSM and support stack. As such, how we handle these integrations is crucial for the performance, security, and general effectiveness of our chatbot solution.

This is necessary both for calling tools and for accessing external data to formulate responses.

Depending on our needs, there are a few different ways that this can be managed.

Many AI agent platforms utilize what’s known as a model context protocol (MCP) server. This is a standard that provides a structured approach for chatbots to connect to tools and data, simplifying integrations and reducing the need for custom connectors.

Alternatively, many chatbot solutions also rely on direct API connections to ITSM platforms or other relevant internal tools. This is especially common in situations where we need tighter controls or a greater level of customization for creating defined workflows.

For instance, if a specific function requires an ordered sequence of calls to different tools, such as our CMDB, knowledge base, and ticketing system.

As a result, many teams leverage low-code automation tools, such as Zapier, n8n, or Budibase, to define and manage these kinds of functions.

## Types of chatbot solutions

Understanding the various elements and architectural layers that make up an IT helpdesk chatbot, we can next turn our attention to the kinds of solutions which are available to us.

As with any software tool, these exist on a spectrum, with off-the-shelf options on one end and fully custom builds on the other.

Let’s check out what the market here looks like in the case of IT chatbots.

### Off-the-shelf chatbots

Firstly, we have COTS options. These are generally ready-to-implement solutions, although they’ll typically still offer a degree of configurability, in order for us to define our own workflows or integrate with our wider software stack.

Broadly speaking, off-the-shelf IT chatbots come in two varieties. 

On the one hand, we have general chatbot tools that can be configured for IT support use cases. For instance, we can configure ChatGPT for these kinds of workflows using the Chatkit platform.

On the other hand, most of the leading ITSM platforms now also offer ready-to-use chatbot solutions, including for conversational support workflows.

These can be quite varied, depending on the complexity of the platform itself. So, many will be tightly tied to native functions within the platform, but some more advanced ITSM solutions will also offer more customization within our chatbots.

Across the board, the main benefit here is time-to-value. That is, compared to the other options we’ll see in a second, we can get a solution up and running relatively quickly.

The downside is that COTS options are generally less customizable, and we might struggle to achieve certain key enterprise functionality. For instance, we might be able to choose from a set of supported LLMs, but this falls short of a full bring-your-own-model approach.

Off-the-shelf options can also have fairly limited support for self-hosting.

### Custom solutions

As ever, the obvious alternative to COTS software is a fully custom build. However, there’s a slightly different complexion to this in the case of AI chat tools, in the sense that very few teams will build *all aspects* of these from scratch.

Most notably, it’s unlikely that you’ll want to develop your own LLM in order to create a helpdesk chatbot.

Instead, in this context, a custom solution will include substantial custom-coded elements, but we’ll more than likely also leverage existing artefacts and services.

Often, this means leveraging reactive frameworks such as React or Svelte to build a custom front-end, while handling back-end logic and connections to our LLM using an [agentic AI framework](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/ai-agent-frameworks/), such as LangGraph.

As you might expect, the primary benefit of this approach is the extent of control and customization that it offers. That is, we’re essentially free to build whatever we want.

At the same time, this comes with a comparatively high resource burden, both in terms of development and maintenance. This can mean that building a custom helpdesk chatbot is well beyond the means of many teams.

### Modular solutions

Lastly, more and more teams are leveraging what we could describe as `modular` solutions to create custom support chatbots.

Essentially, this involves leveraging pre-built elements for different layers of our overall solution, within a custom configuration.

For example, utilizing pre-built front-end and integration layers that are model agnostic, meaning we can connect them to the LLM of our choice.

Again, though, there are important variations across different platforms within this class of chatbot tools. 

One element to this is considering no-code vs low-code options, and the extent of customization that comes along with each. To see some of our options here, take a look at our guide to [no-code AI agent builders](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/no-code-ai-agent-builders/).

Additionally, the scope of what individual platforms offer can vary. So, some platforms might only offer chat interfaces, while others have more comprehensive capabilities around defining callable workflows.

In any case, the goal is to provide a greater amount of customization and flexibility than would be possible in a COTS chatbot, without incurring the development and maintenance costs of a fully custom build.

## What to look for in an IT helpdesk chatbot

Now that we know the kinds of solutions we can leverage to implement a helpdesk chatbot of our own, our next task is to check out some of the key decisions we’ll need to make in order to implement a solution that meets our requirements.

We can break this into a few key areas.

The first of these is core functionality. That is, we need to assess the solution’s capabilities against what we actually need it to do.

This includes considerations such as:

- **Conversational intelligence** - The ability to interpret natural language, maintain context across turns, and formulate responses. 
- **Automation depth** - How well the chatbot can execute or trigger actions—resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, or escalating tickets.
- **Integrations** - Compatibility with existing ITSM systems, identity providers, and automation tools.
- **Knowledge management** - The ability to retrieve information from internal knowledge bases or documentation repositories.
- **User experience** - Including the core experience for our chatbot UI, as well as availability across other platforms, if required.

Taken together, these determine how well the chatbot fits into the day-to-day of our IT operations and whether it actually reduces manual workload.

We’ll also need to consider non-functional requirements, especially with regard to security and compliance. This is particularly important, as many teams struggle to achieve value from AI solutions as they can’t implement solutions that meet their wider security needs.

As such, large organizations in particular will want to prioritize:

- **Self-hosting options** - The ability to deploy and operate the chatbot within your own environment, whether on-premises or in a private cloud configuration.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Fine-grained permissions to govern which users, groups, or systems the chatbot can act on behalf of.
- **Data sovereignty** - Control over where data is stored, processed, and transmitted.
- **Authentication and authorization** - Integration with enterprise identity systems such as SSO, LDAP, or Azure AD to maintain consistent access policies.
- **Data protection** - Encryption in transit and at rest, plus detailed logging for audit and incident response.

 

Lastly, in order to achieve return-on-investment from our IT chatbot, we’ll need to consider the upfront and ongoing costs of implementing a solution, as well as how we can maintain and scale it over time.

This includes decisions around:

- **Licensing and pricing** - Whether costs scale by user, conversation, or feature, and how that aligns with our usage.
- **Infrastructure overhead** - Requirements for compute, monitoring, and redundancy, if self-hosting.
- **Scalability** - The ability to handle fluctuating demand and maintain predictable performance.
- **Maintenance effort** - How easily we can modify behaviour, workflows, or integrations.
- **Support and ecosystem:** Availability of documentation, community plugins, and vendor support channels.

Importantly, the specific attention we pay to each of these considerations will vary from one team to the next. Therefore, what’s important is to have a clear picture of your own requirements and real-world intended usage, in order to determine the appropriate solution for your own needs.

## Implementation best practices and challenges

Before we wrap up, we also need to consider some of the practicalities of rolling out an IT service chatbot. So far, we’ve covered the different kinds of solutions that are available, how these work at a technical level, and how we can choose the right one for our needs.

However, effective implementation is more than simply a technical question. 

Rather, this requires appropriate measures for data quality, process alignment, user adoption, and more, in order for our chatbot to act as a fully engrained part of our wider ITSM workflows.

With this in mind, some of the most common implementation challenges we’re likely to face include:

- **Unclear scope and objectives** - Deployments that begin without a well-defined set of use cases tend to sprawl quickly and fail to achieve value.
- **Integration complexity** - Connecting the chatbot with ticketing systems, authentication services, and automation tools can expose inconsistent APIs, data duplication, or access gaps.
- **Process misalignment** - When conversational flows don’t mirror existing ITSM procedures, tickets may be logged incorrectly, or escalation paths can become fragmented.
- **Low-quality or outdated knowledge sources** - If the underlying documentation is inaccurate, the chatbot’s reliability can suffer.
- **Resistance from support staff** - Analysts may view automation as disruptive or fear loss of control if governance and communication are poor.
- **User confusion or unrealistic expectations** - Without clear messaging about what the chatbot can and cannot do, users may disengage after a few poor interactions.

None of these are necessarily deal-breakers, though.

Instead, what these implementation challenges highlight is the need to adhere to established best practices in order to ensure a successful rollout. For instance, we can:

- **Define measurable, incremental use cases**  - Begin with well-scoped workflows, such as password resets or account unlocks, before scaling to more complex scenarios.
- **Integrate early with core systems** - Prioritize secure, well-documented integrations with ITSM, identity, and automation platforms during setup. 
- **Align automation with existing ITSM processes** - Map chatbot actions to the same categories, priorities, and escalation logic used by human agents to ensure consistency in reporting and accountability.
- **Audit and maintain knowledge sources** - Establish a process for reviewing and updating articles, FAQs, and configuration data.
- **Include service desk teams in design and training** - Involve agents in intent modeling, escalation rules, and post-deployment tuning to increase accuracy.
- **Implement structured governance and review cycles** - Assign ownership for monitoring chatbot logs, analyzing performance metrics, and approving updates or retraining.

In short, rather than rolling out a helpdesk chatbot and assuming it will simply provide value straight out of the box, we need to be conscious of how we can align this as closely as possible with the existing processes and pain points of our IT team.

### KPIs and measuring success

In order to measure the effectiveness of an IT chatbot implementation, we’ll need suitable performance indicators. 

That is, if we suddenly replace L1 service interactions with an automated system, we’re obviously going to spend less money on labor hours. But this ignores the quality of the interactions.

So, to accurately measure our chatbot’s performance, we need to establish KPIs and benchmarks that take into account both finances and our effectiveness at handling incoming requests.

Some of the metrics we might utilize here include:

- **Resolution and deflection rates** - The proportion of requests fully resolved by the chatbot without human intervention.
- **Response and resolution time** - Average time saved per request compared to traditional handling.
- **Intent accuracy and knowledge relevance** - How consistently the chatbot interprets user intent and surfaces correct information.
- **User satisfaction and engagement** - Ratings, feedback, and completion rates that reflect overall confidence in the chatbot.
- **Escalation quality** - How effectively the chatbot transfers context, diagnostic data, and conversation history when handing off to a human agent.
- **Operational and cost efficiency** - The combined impact on staffing demand, per-ticket cost, and overall service throughput.

Additionally, in order to ensure long-term value, we’ll want to track these metrics over time, especially as we iterate over our chatbot solution, adding extra capabilities or other modifications.
