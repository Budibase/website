More and more teams are prioritizing open-source workflow management tools to power their internal processes.

Balancing the ever-growing need for efficiency with security and other operational factors like vendor lock-in often means that open-source is the preferable option, especially in larger organizations handling mission-critical workflows.

At the same time, this is a fast-evolving space, with the rise of AI rapidly transforming the way that businesses handle all kinds of workflows.

Today, we’re diving deep into this space by checking out some of the top open-source workflow management tools on the market in 2026.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What are open-source workflow management tools?](#what-are-open-source-workflow-management-tools)
- [Why handle workflows with open-source tools?](#why-handle-workflows-with-open-source-tools)
- [What to look for in an open-source workflow management platform](#what-to-look-for-in-an-open-source-workflow-management-platform)
- [6 open-source workflow management tools for 2026](#6-open-source-workflow-management-tools-for-2026)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What are open source workflow management tools?

Open source workflow management tools are software systems with open-source code that enable us to plan, automate, and monitor business tasks.

Generally, this means providing an interface for creating automation rules to determine how and when a workflow should be executed, including its trigger, constituent steps, and any additional logic that’s required.

In recent years, more and more workflow tools have also introduced AI capabilities alongside traditional deterministic automation functionality.

The goal is to standardize the steps that are required to achieve the workflow’s underlying goal, as well as to remove the need for employees to carry these out manually.

However, a fairly broad range of tools fall under this umbrella.

One important issue here is the extent of customization and flexibility on offer. For instance, some tools are more focused on enabling teams to implement custom code within their workflows, while others prioritize ease-of-use and exclusively visual development tools.

At the same time, tools can vary in terms of their intended use cases. So, some platforms are tailored towards quite granular sets of use cases, while others might be optimized for specific types of workflows and processes.

In a moment, we’ll also consider some of the key decision points that determine which platforms are most suitable for our needs.

## Why handle workflows with open-source tools?

Knowing what workflow management tools are more generally, it’s also important to understand the key reasons why teams prioritize open-source solutions.

There are several overlapping reasons for this. 

Firstly, the ability to review and audit source code is crucial for many security-focused organizations. This is especially important for workflow tools that will interact with mission-critical data, infrastructure, and systems.

Similarly, open-source tools are generally available to host locally, rather than relying on the vendor’s cloud infrastructure. This is critical for teams that don’t want their workflow data to leave their local environment.

For many types of tools, self-hosting is less likely to be offered by COTS equivalents. In cases where it is, it’s often within more expensive licensing tiers, which may not be viable for all teams and use cases.

On top of this, open-source tools can often be preferable from an operations and procurement perspective, especially when handling important internal workflows, helping to mitigate risks such as vendors adjusting pricing or ceasing to operate entirely.

In many cases, open-source platforms will have more active communities, providing support resources, plug-ins, or expanded functionality, which can also be attractive to certain teams and users.

## What to look for in an open-source workflow management platform

As we noted earlier, there’s a fair amount of variation between tools in this space, including in terms of key use cases and target user personas. This can draw on a range of factors across both functional and non-functional requirements.

So, before we check out our specific options, it’s helpful to consider some of the important decision points we’re likely to encounter when comparing individual platforms.

As we hinted at earlier, one of the key elements to this is the core experience for defining workflow logic within different platforms. Most platforms utilize flow-based visual experiences for creating automation rules, but there are variations on this, including more reliance on code editing in certain platforms.

Because of this, certain tools might feel better optimized for more technical colleagues, while others aim to be usable by a wider range of user personas.

Another key consideration is the range of integration options on offer within individual platforms, as well as the experiences for connecting to external systems. So, we’ll want to be confident that any platform we’re considering can connect reliably to our wider tech stack to perform the automation actions we need.

In recent years, AI, especially AI agents, has become central to how businesses handle internal workflows. Many workflow management platforms have introduced capabilities to meet this demand, but at the same time, this has introduced new and important considerations and decision points.

In particular, we need to be cognizant of the models and tools supported by various platforms, alongside experiences for performing key tasks, such as building agents, monitoring decisions, and implementing human-in-the-loop logic.

Of course, we’ll also need to consider factors around pricing, licensing, and support arrangements. For instance, many platforms have different offerings for their paid and open-source versions. The specific models that these are offered under will hugely impact their viability for individual teams and use cases.
