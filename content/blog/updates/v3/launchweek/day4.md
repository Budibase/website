Today, we’re excited to release several new AI features. These latest enhancements will enable you to power your workflows securely with AI.

In total, we have four new AI features to demo:

1. [AI Configs](#ai-configs)
2. [Budibase AI](#budibase-ai)
3. [AI CRON generator](#ai-cron-generator)
4. [AI Column](#ai-column)

## AI Configs
With AI Configs, you can connect your LLM to Budibase. Once connected, you can use your LLM to power multiple AI workflows within Budibase and the apps you build.

Today, Budibase supports Open AI compatible LLMs, including:

- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- Anthropic
- TogetherAI

You can also add other OpenAI-compatible LLMs using the Custom option.

We will continue to add to the list of supported LLMs.

#### Pricing and availability
AI Configs are only available to Premium customers and all Enterprise customers.

#### Getting started
To get started, go to your Budibase home screen and click settings (top navigation). The AI Config page is the first option in the sub-nav. Add your AI configuration, and you’re ready to level up your workflows with AI.

 
## Budibase AI
Our second feature is Budibase AI, the perfect alternative for users without access to an LLM.  It’s powered by ChatGPT, and it’s the easiest and fastest way to add the following AI functionality to your workflows. 

#### Pricing and availability
Today, this feature is only available to Premium Cloud users. It’s switched off by default, but you can opt-in from the AI settings page. We plan to make Budibase AI available to self-hosted users soon.

#### Getting started
Budibase AI is available out of the box. It’s switched off by default. To activate it, you will need to go to your Budibase home screen and click settings (top navigation). The AI Config page is the first option in the sub-nav. Click Budibase AI, then Activate. This feature is only available to Premium Cloud and Enterprise users.


## AI CRON generator
The third AI feature is the AI CRON generator. The CRON trigger within automations is very popular, running thousands of times every month. When setting up your CRON trigger, this new feature allows you to use natural language instead of complicated CRON expressions. Write "Every Tuesday at 3PM,” and the LLM will generate the CRON expression.

#### Pricing and availability
This feature is only available if you have Budibase AI activated or successfully connected an AI Config.

#### Getting started
Head to the Automations section and create a new automation. Give your automation a name, and select CRON as your trigger.


## AI Column
The fourth and, internally, our favorite AI feature is the new, powerful AI column. The latest AI column harnesses the power of AI plus the context of data within your row. Simply select the AI column, add a prompt, and let AI do the work for you - from analyzing customer feedback to triaging support tickets, drafting responses, or writing inventory descriptions. The new AI column also works when connected to databases such as Postgres and MySQL, and is particularly powerful when combined with the latest data experience. It’s never been easier or more secure to power your workflows with AI.

#### Pricing and availability
This feature is only available if you have Budibase AI activated or successfully connected an AI Config.

#### Getting started
Head to the data section of your app. Add Budibase DB as a data source. Create a new table, click the add column button, give your new column a name — ‘AI test’ — and select AI Column as your column type.

This is just the beginning of helping you make work flow securely with AI. We look forward to telling you more and giving you a sneak peek into the future of Budibase during our final launch day tomorrow. If you want to continue the conversation, head to our Discord. Have a nice day, buddies.
