It’s the final day of our first launch week, and today, we’re going to look into the future of Budibase.


It’s been two years since we launched Budibase 2.0. In that time, we’ve launched several game-changing features, including multi-player mode, global bindings, screen templates, and lots more. Now, with the 3.0 launch, we firmly believe our new data-first experience positions Budibase as the best, and most secure platform for building workflow apps.

## Templates
To support this claim, we’re launching three new production-ready templates covering the following workflows. To get started, simply the click the template of your choice:

1. [Change control](https://budibase.app/builder?template=app/change-request)

2. [Expense approval](https://budibase.app/builder?template=app/expense-approval)

3. [Risk management](https://budibase.app/builder?template=app/risk-management)

We’ve also added how-to guides within the [Budibase Docs](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/templates).

## Future
This release puts us in an excellent position for our next chapter.

I’ve never seen Budibase as a no-code platform, or a low-code platform. I’ve always seen it as a platform for transforming workflows, after all, our brand motto is “Make work flow”.

When you consider it, a workflow is simply a sequence of tasks and decisions. And today, our users transform company workflows with Budibase apps. We’ve invested heavily in our app-building experience and will continue to do so.

But, apps are just a part of the workflow equation. We see a huge opportunity to evolve Budibase automations. An opportunity to help our users transform workflows with AI agents.

What if, when you recorded a risk or an incident, Budibase agents could automatically suggest an improvement plan to reduce the risk or avoid future incidents. AI agents could even identify the most high-impact improvements across all your risks, saving you time and improving output.

So, over the next few months, we will focus on becoming the most secure, open, and enjoyable platform for transforming workflows with AI. On top of that, we plan to invest more in the community and provide our users with a place where they can transform workflows together.

And on that note, that’s the wrap for the 3.0 launch week. We hope you've enjoyed the launch week, please let us know what you think in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/zgaSJDEH).

Have a great day Buddies,
