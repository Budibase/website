## Why Budibase 3.0?
This release was inspired by a key insight: Budibase engineers are most productive when configuring data and logic versus designing interfaces.

With the 3.0 release, we aimed to create an exceptional data-first experience for building secure workflow applications. We’ve reimagined the process of setting up your data structures, configuring security, and effortlessly generating interfaces. It's still early, but the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive so far, and we hope you enjoy it too!

This blog gives a quick wrap-up of each day of the 3.0 launch week.

## Day 1: The New Data Experience

We kicked off Budibase 3.0 launch week with a deep dive into the new data experience, introducing five major features designed to make app-building faster, more secure, and more streamlined than ever:

### Enhanced Views
Views are now the core of Budibase's data management, allowing you to set up unique views per role, with detailed permissions to control access and visibility. This update brings a secure-by-design approach, enabling granular access control from the start.

### Default Values
With Default Values, it’s easier to standardize data entry and keep information consistent. You can set initial values like “In Progress” for status fields, reducing manual work and keeping data organized.

### Row Actions
Row Actions link data to automations, creating dynamic workflows based on user roles. For example, actions like “Approve” or “Edit” can be role-specific, offering flexibility without compromising security.

### View Joins
View Joins allow you to pull related data from other tables directly into your view, simplifying workflows without altering your database schema. This feature adds context to data securely, as joined information remains view-only.

### Dynamic Screen Generation
With just one click, generate fully functional screens from your Views, choosing from templates or pre-built forms. This feature brings your data to life instantly, making app-building both faster and more accessible.

Together, these updates offer a data-centric, secure, and efficient foundation for building Budibase apps.

## Day 2: Visual RBAC


Following the new data experience, Budibase 3.0's Day 2 introduced Visual Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which simplifies setting up and understanding user permissions across your app.

The new drag-and-drop editor lets you visually define roles with a clear view of each role’s permissions. Drag and connect roles to establish hierarchies, offering an intuitive way to manage role permissions in Budibase.

Roles can be either hierarchical or completely distinct, giving you more control over your permission structure, and giving users the true access they need. 

Budibase 3.0 makes managing user permissions intuitive and adaptable, enhancing security without adding complexity.

## Day 3: Automation Branching
On Day 3, we introduced Automation Branching, enabling powerful, multi-step workflows. Budibase automations now better support advanced use cases such as approval flows and ticket systems.

You can quickly reorder branches and drag-and-drop specific steps. For managing larger workflows, the new pan and zoom controls help you navigate or view your entire automation. 

With Automation Branching, Budibase 3.0 adds flexibility and control to every workflow.

## Day 4: AI

On Day 4, we took a bold step forward by introducing AI to Budibase, unlocking new levels of efficiency and intelligence in app-building. This release isn’t just about adding functionality; it’s about starting a journey with AI that reimagines what’s possible in Budibase. 

{{< youtube id="WR1cCHWVLtw" >}}

As AI becomes an integral part of workflows, we’re excited to be at the forefront of a new era—one where automation becomes intuitive, workflows become smarter, and IT teams can focus more strategically. 

This release introduced four exciting new AI Features:

### AI Configs
First up, AI Configs allow users to connect OpenAI-compatible large language models, such as OpenAI, Azure, and Anthropic, to Budibase. This integration powers multiple AI workflows within Budibase and the apps you build, enhancing automation with ease.

### Budibase AI
For those without direct access to an LLM, Budibase AI offers an alternative, powered by ChatGPT. Available to Premium Cloud users, Budibase AI is the fastest way to integrate AI into workflows directly from Budibase’s AI settings.

### AI CRON Generator
The AI CRON Generator simplifies scheduling with natural language, transforming inputs like “Every Tuesday at 3 PM” into CRON expressions. 

### AI Columns
The final feature, AI Columns, brings the power of AI directly to your data. By adding an AI column to any table, users can analyze feedback, triage tickets, or draft responses within the context of each row. 

These updates mark the beginning of Budibase’s journey into secure, AI-powered workflows, setting the stage for even more intelligent automation. Just as past technological revolutions transformed society, AI stands ready to reshape the way we work, helping teams and organizations operate smarter, faster, and with greater impact. We believe that within the next decade, almost all internal workflows will be supported by AI agents, and Budibase is in a prime position to help engineers and teams make this transformation a reality.

## Day 5 - The Future of Budibase

On our final day of Budibase 3.0 Launch Week, we looked to the future of Budibase and what lies ahead. 

{{< youtube id="ts2uFSwmCyM" >}}

Since Budibase 2.0, we’ve added features like multi-player mode, global bindings, and screen templates, with each step moving us closer to our goal of making Budibase the go-to platform for building secure, data-driven workflow apps.

With 3.0’s data-first approach, we’re proud to launch three new production-ready templates for Change Control, Expense Approval, and Risk Management workflows, available directly within the platform and supported by user guides in our docs.

But we’re not stopping here. Budibase isn’t simply a low-code or no-code platform—it’s a platform for transforming workflows. While our focus on app-building remains strong, we envision a future where AI agents are at Budibase’s core. Imagine recording a risk or incident, and Budibase agents proactively suggest improvement plans, even prioritizing actions across multiple workflows for maximum impact.

As we look ahead, our commitment is clear: We’re building a secure, open, and beautifully designed platform for the future of workflow transformation. We’re also excited to invest even more in our community, creating a place where you can connect, innovate, and build together with us.
