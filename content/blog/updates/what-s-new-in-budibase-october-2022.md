### Blocks ejection

Blocks are an important and popular part of the design flow within Budibase. They simplify and speed up the design process. But, their opinionated approach can lead to roadblocks - until now. When using a block, if you hit a roadblock, you can now eject the block, and its inner components will become independently available to customize.
