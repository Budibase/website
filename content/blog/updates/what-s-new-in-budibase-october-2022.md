### New drag-and-drop experience

When designing apps, you can now drag-and-drop components and blocks from the components and blocks side panel onto your design screen.

### Blocks ejection

Blocks are an important and popular part of the design flow within Budibase. They simplify and speed up the design process. But, their opinionated approach can lead to roadblocks - until now. When using a block, if you hit a roadblock, you can now eject the block, and its inner components will become independently available to customize.

### Row explorer block

A personal favorite, this block, when added to your interface, will make it quick and easy for your users to cycle through records.

## Experiments / Research 👩🏻‍🔬

Grid component - Beta

We’re testing the idea of implementing a drag-and-drop grid experience. The new grid component allows you to drag-and-drop components onto a grid. You can let customize the size by dragging the component/blocks sides.
