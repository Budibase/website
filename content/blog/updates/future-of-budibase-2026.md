# Budibase - AI Workflows for privacy-first teams

Every few years, a platform hits a crossroads. Budibase recently faced that same turning point, driven by a rapidly changing AI landscape and the evolving needs of privacy-first organizations. To keep serving these teams, we must evolve. Here’s how we’re approaching this shift.

In [my last post](https://budibase.com/blog/updates/low-code-versus-vibe-code/), I compared Lowcode to AI Code generators. Now, I’ll focus on Budibase - what we believe, what we’re doubling down on, and where we’re heading.

## What we stand for

These principles are the foundation of everything we build:

- **Privacy**. Keep your data within your own infrastructure and trusted providers.
- **Ownership**. Stay in control of your data and the software that processes it.
- **Connectivity**. No walled gardens - connect to the tools that you trust.
- **Humans in the loop**. The future is AI **Assisted**. People still make the critical decisions.

Budibase has always been built for organizations that prioritize security, compliance, and data residency. As AI becomes foundational to modern workflows, our mission is simple:

EWnable privacy-first teams to adopt AI with confidence - without sending sensitive data to external clouds.

# Budibase - the AI Workflow Toolkit

Today, you can build low-code apps and automations with Budibase. That won't change. In fact, automations and apps will become even more powerful. 

We're betting on a future where AI assistants will be embedded in most workflows. To support this, we're adding two huge pillars to Budibase Workspaces:

## 1. Agents

AI Agents work best when they are single-purpose - where each agent has a clear set of instructions and a limited set of tools to use.

Inside Budibase, you’ll be able to create multiple specialized agents - each with access only to the data and APIs you choose. The chat interface (or another agent) will help orchestrate which agent to call for each request.

Agents will be usable via automations and the new chat interface (below).

And, most importantly, Role-based access controls will apply.

- No agent can bypass your permissions.
- No human can see or anything they have not been given access to.

Budibase provides the foundation for secure AI automation in regulated environments.

## 2. Chat++

You already know how to use chat - you use it every day with AI,  and with colleagues.

But chat alone isn’t enough for real internal workflows - we’re taking it further.

Budibase Chat will surface dynamic forms, tables, and charts within the chat experience, combining the flexibility of free-text with the structure of traditional user interfaces.

Budibase has always enabled teams to build secure internal workflows. Now, we’re bringing AI into that world in a way that matches the needs of privacy-first organizations.

AI workflows, private LLMs, strict data residency, full RBAC, and multi-agent orchestration - all under your control.
