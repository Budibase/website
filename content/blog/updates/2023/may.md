## Multiplayer collaboration

Today we’re thrilled to announce multiplayer collaboration support for the data section within Budibase. Now, multiple users can work together to connect to data sources, customize schemas, and update data within our new spreadsheet-like grid, all at the same time.

## Autocomplete bindings

Bindings offer a powerful way to link data within Budibase. With our latest update, binding data has never been easier / faster. To access a context menu and all available bindings and helpers, press `{{` when using Handlebars and `$` when using JavaScript.

## Synchronous Automations

> **Available on the [Business tier](https://budibase.com/pricing) and above**

One of the longest running requests we have had is the ability to run Automations synchronously, and chain together responses from Automation steps. With this release, you can now add a **Collect** step to your Automations and pass data down your Automation pipeline.

  You can now search users within a user group, user groups cannot have the same name, there’s now a max character limit on user group names.
