The Budibase team is excited to introduce a few updates to our pricing plans that will **go live in the next few weeks**. Over the past 5 months, we’ve chatted with our current customers and users to determine how to best correlate our pricing with the value of Budibase. Consistently, we were told per-user pricing was not scalable and the value experienced by app creators was disproportionate to the value experienced by app users. 

In the upcoming pricing release, we’ve streamlined our pricing plans to create a better experience for everyone. Here’s a quick summary of what will change, and what’s staying the same:

- Instead of charging the same per-user fee for all users, we will price differently for users who *create* apps (app creators) and those who *use* apps (app users). This breakdown in pricing will allow us to offer a **reduced per-user fee**.  
- We will have 3 pricing plans. Each plan is available to Budibase Cloud and Self-hosted users. 
- We’ve removed the Business plan. All Business plan features will move to the Enterprise plan. 
- We’re introducing volume-based discounts to the Enterprise plan to help us serve different use cases and user types.



## The new model

![new model](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1697032289/cms/pricing/CleanShot_2023-10-11_at_14.50.48_2x_o9qx4v.png)

The new pricing model is simpler, more scalable and better tied to value. This allows us to provide a lower per-user rate based on quotas and volume based discounts for more customers. For example:

- **Old Premium plan vs new Premium plan:**
  If a customer had 1 creator and 30 users on the old Premium plan they would pay $2,976 per annum. With the new Premium plan, they will pay $2,400 per annum.
- **Old Business plan vs new Enterprise plan:**
  If a customer had 2 creators and 70 users on the old Budibase plan they would be pay $13,824 per annum. With the new enterprise plan, they will pay as little as $13,200 per annum.
