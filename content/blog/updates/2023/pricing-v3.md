Today, the Budibase team is excited to introduce a few updates to our pricing plans. Over the past few months, we’ve chatted with our current customers and users to determine how to best correlate our pricing with the value of Budibase. Consistently, we heard from you that per-user pricing was not scalable and that the value experienced by app creators was disproportionate to the value experienced by app users. 

Now, we’ve streamlined our pricing plans to create a better experience for everyone. Here’s a quick summary of what’s changed, and what’s staying the same:

- Instead of charging the same per-user fee for all users, we now price differently for users who *create* apps and those who *use* apps. 
- We now have 3 pricing plans. Each plan is available to Budibase Cloud and Self-hosted users. 
- Our Free plan is still free for up to 5 users (admins, app creators, app users) when hosting with Budibase Cloud, and free for up to 20 users (admins, app creators, app users) when self-hosting - no longer unlimited. Uniquely, we will continue to offer SSO, multiplayer collaboration, RBAC, embeds, and more for free.
- We’re excited to announce a new, competitively priced Premium plan for both Budibase Cloud and Self-hosted users. We’ve increased the internal database record limit to 25,000 and automation run limit to 5,000 for Premium plan customers hosting with Budibase Cloud. We’ve also increased the duration of backups and automation logs on the Premium plan (Cloud and Self-hosted) from 1 week to 1 month.
- Self-hosted users/customers will continue to benefit from unlimited internal database records and automation runs.
- We’ve removed the Business plan. All Business plan features will move to the Enterprise plan. 
- Current customers may remain on their plans until the 31st March 2024 or until their contract is up.
- We’re introducing volume-based discounts to the Enterprise plan to help us better serve different use cases and user types.
- The new pricing will go live in 14 days.



## The new model

The new model is more streamlined and better coordinated with value, consisting of just 3 plans vs the 7 plans we had previously. Each plan is available to Budibase Cloud and Self-hosted users. The Enterprise plan has absorbed the Business plan.This allows us to provide a lower per-user rate based on quotas and volume based discounts for more customers. The new pricing is more flexible and better correlated with the value Budibase provides. It’s also a lot cheaper for many customers. For example:

- **Old Premium plan vs new Premium plan:**
  If a customer has 1 creator and 30 users on the old Premium plan they would be paying $2,976. With the new Premium plan, they will be paying $2,400.
- **Old Business plan vs new Enterprise plan:**
  If a customer had 2 creators and 70 users on the old Budibase plan they would be paying $13,824. With the new enterprise plan, they would be paying $13,200.





## FAQs

#### **I already have a Budibase account. What’s changing for me?**

If you created a Budibase account before today, and have updated to the latest version of Budibase, here’s what has changed for you, broken down by plan type:



**Free and Community plans:**

- Your plan is now named “Free Plan”

- You can add up to a combined total of 5 users/creators on Cloud. If you self-host you can add up to a combined total of 20 users/creators (for example, 15 app users + 4 app creators + 1 account admin = 20 users). 

  

**Premium plan:**

Your pricing has changed and limits increased. 

- Customers paying monthly - If you are on a monthly contract you can upgrade or remain on your current plan until 31st March 2024. On the 1st April 2024, you will be required to move to the new Premium plan. If you’d like to upgrade to the new pricing today, please [contact our sales team](https://budibase.com/contact).

- Customers paying annually - If you are on an annual contract you will remain on that contract until the end of your annual contract. Once your annual contract ends, you will be moved to the new Premium plan.

**Enterprise plan:**

- No changes, but lots of new features have been introduced! Enterprise pricing will be determined by the number of creators/users within your account as well as the level of support required.



#### **I’m currently using the Budibase community plan and my account has over 20 users. What is going to happen to my account and users?**

Community plan accounts with over 20 users/creators on older versions of Budibase will continue to operate as they are today. If you upgrade to the latest version or future versions of Budibase, and you’re on the **free plan with over 20 users/creators**:

- You will benefit from new features and security updates
- You will not be able to add new users. To continue to have the ability to add users, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan. To upgrade, please [contact our sales team](https://budibase.com/contact).
- You will need to reduce your user/creator levels to meet the 20 user limit or upgrade to a paid plan.

We want to continue supporting and powering your workflows, and we’re happy to discuss a path that works for both parties - please [contact our sales team](https://budibase.com/contact) and we’ll work with you to unlock a new, better Budibase experience.



#### **How do I know what plan I am on and how many users I have?**

In your Budibase portal, click Account > Usage and your plan is listed at the top of the screen. Underneath your plan name you will find your usage stats and allocations.
