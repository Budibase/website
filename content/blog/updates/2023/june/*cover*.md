## Add multiplayer collaboration to your published apps with the new Grid block

After much anticipation, you can now add our new Grid interface directly into your applications. This powerful, new design block enables multiple users to collaborate in real-time within your apps. The Grid will reflect you data source of choice, and allow you to customize whether end users can create, edit or delete rows. 

You can try the new Grid Block [below](#embed).

## OpenAI automation action

> The OpenAI automation action is currently only available in self hosted Budibase installations. An OpenAI API key is required.



Connect ChatGPT to Budibase automations and build AI apps in minutes with the new OpenAI automation action. This new functionality packs a lot of power and will improve many workflows. We've created a quick tutorial to help you get started:

## Embed

With the Budibase Embed feature, you can share your public apps outside of Budibase and integrate them directly within websites or apps. You can try a Budibase embed below:

## Typeahead plugin

The typeahead plugin can be used for querying tables, searching through results, selecting and then saving selected items back to your datasource of choice. This improves performance by querying the datasource directly and returning results based on the search value.

To add the Typeahead plugin to your Budibase account, navigate to the Plugins section, click Add plugin, and add the following URL:

```

```

## New home for app settings

We've moved app settings from the portal to the app building experience. The experience feels natural and should make it easier and faster to access settings and information relating to your app.
