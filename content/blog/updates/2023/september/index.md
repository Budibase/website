The September release is here and it comes with a number of crowd-pleasing, community-driven changes that will improve the app building and  access experience:



---



## Retain user & table data when overriding applications

Weâ€™ve been asked time and time again for the ability to update an application without impacting the user or data tables. From today, you can import applications, while retaining these artifacts.

---



## User columns now available (and updates to the user table)

The user table as you know today will still exist, but in a read-only format. If you have user assignment needs, please use the new user column.

## Support for date-only field types

Previously we only supported DATETIME type fields, requiring users to set a default time for their value. Now we support DATE type values as well.

## View and interact with your applications directly in the Budibase portal 

We have redesigned our portal experience, allowing you to use your applications directly within the portal view.

## Query UI improvements

We have made improvements to the query creation process for data sources allowing you to view your query results side-by-side with your query string and transformer.
