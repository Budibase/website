The Budibase team is excited to introduce updates to our pricing plans that will **go live on the 28th of November, 2023**. 

Here’s a quick summary of what will change:

- Instead of charging the same per-user fee for all users, we will price differently for users who *create* apps (app creators) and those who *use* apps (app users). This breakdown in pricing will allow us to offer a **reduced per-user fee**. 
- The self-hosted Free plan, which will replace the Community plan, will be limited to 20 users.
- We will have three pricing plans. The Business plan will no longer exist. Each new plan will be available to Budibase Cloud and Self-hosted users. 
- Current customers on a monthly contract may remain on their current plans until the 31st of March, 2024. Customers on an annual contract may stay on their current plans until their contract ends.
- We will introduce volume-based discounts to the Enterprise plan to help us better serve different use cases and user types.



## The new model

Over the past five months, we’ve talked with customers and users to determine how best to correlate our pricing with the value of Budibase. Consistently, customers and users told us that per-user pricing was not scalable and the value experienced by app creators was disproportionate to the value experienced by app users. We hope you agree the new model is more straightforward, scalable and aligns better with the different levels of value Budibase provides.

### I already have a Budibase account. What’s changing for me?

If you created a Budibase account before the 28th of November, 2023, and have updated to the latest version of Budibase, here’s what has changed for you, broken down by plan type:

#### Free and Community plans:

Limits have changed:

- Your plan is now named “Free Plan.”
- The Free plan will continue to be free of charge.

  - $50 per creator and $5 per app user (paying annually)
  - $60 per creator and $6 per app user (paying monthly)
- If you pay monthly, you can upgrade or remain on your current plan. On the 1st of April 2024, if you are still on the legacy Premium plan, we will move you to the new Premium Plan. If you pay annually, you will be transferred to the new Premium plan when your contract ends. 
- The Premium plan is now available to self-hosted users.

- When moving to the new Enterprise plan, you will benefit from additional features, including enforceable SSO and SCIM. You can also choose from different support options to help scale your deployments.
- The Business plan will no longer exist for new customers. Its features and functionality will be available within the Enterprise plan.

#### Enterprise plan:

You will experience little change.

- All current enterprise customers will experience no change until their contract ends. At renewal, we can provide a custom quote based on the number of app creators and app users within your account, as well as the level of support required.

### I’m using the Budibase community plan, and my account has over 20 users. What is going to happen to my account and users?

Community plan accounts with over 20 users (admins, app creators, app users) on older versions (versions before the pricing update) of Budibase will continue to operate as they do today. If you upgrade to a version of Budibase released after the 28th of November 2023 and you’re on the new free plan:

- You will benefit from new features and security updates.
- You will not be able to add new users. To add new users, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan. To upgrade, please [contact our sales team](https://budibase.com/contact) or upgrade to the new Premium plan within your account portal.
- You must reduce your user levels to meet the 20-user limit or upgrade to a paid plan.

We want to continue supporting and powering your workflows, and we’re happy to discuss a path that works for both parties - please [contact our sales team](https://budibase.com/contact), and we’ll work with you to unlock a new, better Budibase experience.

### How do I know what plan I am on and how many users I have?

### What does the Enterprise plan pricing look like?

Each organization is different, with specific needs. If you’re interested in Budibase’s Enterprise plan, our team would love to talk to you. You can [contact our sales team](https://budibase.com/contact) to learn more.



---



### Why are you limiting the Free plan for self-hosted users?

Budibase will continue to be free for up to 20 users. Once a company hits the 20-user limit, we believe they’ve reached a point where they’ve experienced a level of value that justifies upgrading.

### When will the new pricing go live?

The new pricing will go live on the 28th of November, 2023.
