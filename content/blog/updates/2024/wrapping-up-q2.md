We spent Q2 delivering several new components and quality-of-life improvements. 

### Modal component
This week, we released this new modal component. Modals are a great way to focus the app's interface on a specific experience. The new modal component comes in different sizes, and the design experience is similar to the existing Side Panel component. Kudos to [Gerard](https://github.com/Ghrehh) for getting this out before the end of quarter. Discover more about the [modal component](https://docs.budibase.com/changelog/modal-component).

### Table component improvements
The table component update included a number of new enhancements, fixes and UX improvements delivered by [Andrew](https://github.com/aptkingston). Learn more about all the new [table component improvements](https://docs.budibase.com/changelog/table-component-quality-of-life-improvements).

### Signature component

Thanks to [Dean](https://github.com/deanhannigan), Budibase app users can draw and submit their signatures with the new signature component. Click "add signature" on either the grid or a form field, and a modal with the signature pad will be added. Once a user submits a signature, it is securely stored as an image in that row. Read the [launch blog](https://budibase.com/blog/updates/2024/signature-component/) to learn more.

### Single User column type

Back in April, [Adria](https://github.com/adrinr) added a new [single-user column type](https://docs.budibase.com/changelog/new-single-user-column), offering a more intuitive way to manage values through bindings.
