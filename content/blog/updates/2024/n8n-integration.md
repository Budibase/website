Unlock powerful new workflows with the new Budibase n8n integration. This two-way integration enriches both platforms, offering a better approach for task automation in Budibase and a new way to manage your Budibase data in n8n. 

## Automate workflows with the n8n Integration in Budibase

First up, let's talk about [bringing n8n into Budibase](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/n8n). Integrating n8n into Budibase marks a major step forward in upgrading your workflows. n8n is renowned for its powerful workflow automation capabilities, boasting an impressive array of 775 nodes spanning various applications and services. By weaving n8n's extensive functionality into the fabric of Budibase, we elevate automation to a higher level, significantly expanding the scope of what you can achieve.

Automate a follow-up email sequence, sync customer data across platforms, trigger notifications based on app interactions, and more. With n8n integrated into Budibase, you're not just building apps; you're creating highly intelligent, interconnected digital ecosystems.

## Connect Budibase DB with n8n 

With this release, we're also rolling out the Budibase DB node with n8n. This opens up a straightforward way to manage and update your data within the Budibase database directly through n8n, giving you the ability to automate data administration tasks with ease. 

We're excited to see how you'll use these new capabilities to take your workflows to another level. And as always, we're here to support you every step of the way. So go ahead, give it a try, let us know what you think, and let's make your work truly flow, together!
