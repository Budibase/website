Before Budibase Cloud, it wasn't easy to try Budibase if you were unfamiliar with Docker, Kubernetes, or Digital Ocean. With Budibase Cloud, you can experience the power, sleekness, and simplicity of Budibase in just a few seconds. It is also the beginning of a momentous drive to make Budibase more accessible and intuitive, and offer a best-in-class experience. 

Before jumping in, there are a few points we would like you to know:
- Budibase Cloud is in beta.
- Budibase Cloud is free (we will add paid plans in the future)
- Each new account can build up to 4 applications, run 1000 automation operations, and store 1000 records per app.


Try Budibase today. Setup takes seconds, and it's free. And if you do enjoy your experience, please tell a friend or two about it.

## Theming

We obsess over design at Budibase, and we understand and actively promote the importance of creating internal tools people enjoy using. Theming gives you the creative flexibility to tailor your internal tools to suit your brand. Currently, you can change the overall theme, accent color (button, links), button shape, button hover color, navigation background color, navigation font color).
