Today we're launching Budibase 2.0 - and yes, you can build your own custom components! Budibase 2.0 brings it all together: extensibility, scalability, education, and community. We think you'll love it!

### Features & Improvements

**🎨 Custom plugins (components and datasources)  
**By far our most requested feature - users can now add custom datasources and components, aka plugins, to Budibase. Plugins are stored at the global level allowing you to reuse them across your different apps.

[Visit the docs for custom plugins -->](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/custom-plugin)

**🔌 Plugins repository** 

We've created a plugin repository to store plugins created by the community. We plan to put time and effort into growing this plugin ecosystem over the next few months - including our first hackathon.

[Visit the plugin repository](https://github.com/Budibase/plugins)

**🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User groups** 

User groups are critical when you want to scale your Budibase deployment. User groups are a collection of users who perform a similar task. For example, a group of marketing representatives might be put in a Marketing user group. When you add a user to a group, they are assigned the default permissions of that group. 

**🖇️ Binding groups** 

**🎓 Budibase university** 

**👾 Discord channel**   
Interact with other Budibase community members.

**🧮 Pricing  
**The new pricing allows users to upgrade from free and open-source plans to new paid plans that come with additional features, functionality, and limits.
