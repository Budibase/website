Today, we’re excited to launch **Workspaces**: the first step in a major evolution for Budibase.

## A new architecture for better workflows

Previously, Budibase centered everything around building a single app. Each app had its own automations and data sources. But as teams scaled, reusing automations or data across multiple apps became a challenge.

With Workspaces, that changes. Now, you can group multiple apps, automations, and data sources together within a single workspace. This unlocks two of our most requested features:

- **Shared data sources:** Multiple apps can now use the same datasource within a workspace.
- **Reusable components:** Share components across apps in the same workspace.

A workspace is your toolkit for transforming workflows - housing everything you need to build, automate, and connect processes.

## Design updates

### New navigation

To support Workspaces, we’ve redesigned navigation. The top navigation is replaced by a new, collapsible side navigation that expands on hover. The new layout includes:

- **Header:** Quick access to automations, apps, and data.
- **Favorites:** Pin your go-to apps, automations, tables, and APIs for faster access.
- **Footer:** Settings and User management.

### App & automation index pages

Index pages for apps and automations now show everything in your workspace at a glance. See which apps are published, which aren’t, and when each was last updated. Automations get the same treatment.

### Activate/deactivate apps and automations

You can now activate or deactivate any app—just like automations. Deactivated apps are hidden from users when the workspace is published.

## What’s next
Our mission is simple: **Make the workplace faster**. We’re focused on transforming workflows, not just building apps. Over the next year, we’ll be investing heavily in:
- **Automations:** A complete toolkit for AI automation.
- **Forms:** Making it easier to build beautiful forms.

Combined with Budibase's existing toolkit (app builder, internal database, SQL GUI, REST API connector), Workspaces is our first step in our quest to become the world’s leading open source workflow platform.
