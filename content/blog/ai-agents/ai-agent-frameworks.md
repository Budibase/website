AI agents are becoming more and more common across businesses of all kinds. While the benefits of agentic AI are massive and well documented, their emergence nonetheless presents important challenges for developers. 

In large part, this comes down to the fact that agents are highly complex systems. To alleviate this, a range of tools are available to speed up and simplify the process of AI agent development.

These vary in both scope and approach, aiming to empower a range of different user personas to create agentic systems.

Today, we’re exploring one important segment of this market by checking out some of the most popular AI agent frameworks available to us.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What is an AI agent framework?](#what-is-an-ai-agent-framework)
  - [Benefits](#benefits)
  - [Use cases](#use-cases)
- [What to look for in an AI agent framework](#what-to-look-for-in-an-ai-agent-framework)
- [6 AI agent frameworks for 2025](#6-ai-agent-frameworks-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is an AI agent framework?

AI agent frameworks are sets of reusable tools and elements to help us build, deploy, and manage agentic AI systems. Most often, these are code-based tools, providing a structured approach for developers to create agents of their own.

This generally includes defining the architecture and character of agents, including how they interact with tasks, tools, data, human users, and other agents.

The goal is to provide developers a more streamlined experience for configuring key elements of agentic systems, such as memory, tool-use, integrations, connection to models, oversight, and orchestration.

Frameworks often take the form of libraries for coding languages such as Python or TypeScript, although some also incorporate elements of visual development. 

We can think of this like a blueprint for creating AI agents, determining how different elements should interact in order to create LLM-powered systems, capable of autonomous reasoning and actions.

### Benefits

With a better understanding of what AI agent frameworks are, we can move on to thinking in more detail about how these add value to development projects.

As we hinted at earlier, this largely relates to simplifying and expediting the process of building agents. At a high level, by offering reusable elements and tools, this reduced the amount we have to build from scratch.

In turn, this has a range of technical and business-level benefits, including:

- **Simplified development** - Reducing the complexity of agentic AI development projects.
- **Efficiency** - Frameworks enable us to roll agentic solutions out to a greater number of processes and workflows, enhancing operational efficiency.
- **Scalability** - Frameworks make it easier to scale and modify our agents as our needs evolve.
- **Maintainability** - With reusable elements, frameworks can make solutions easier to maintain compared to fully custom developments.
- **Integration options** - Agent frameworks are heavily focused on empowering developers to integrate LLMs with other tools and services.
- **Customization** - Frameworks offer a greater degree of flexibility and customization compared to some other approaches to building AI agents.
- **Consistency and interoperability** - Frameworks help to ensure we build consistent agents that can more easily interact with one another.

Of course, frameworks also help us to achieve the wider benefits of implementing AI agents. Namely, they make it easier to develop solutions that can act autonomously in pursuit of a goal, in much the way human users would.

### Use cases

Building on what we’ve learned so far about the benefits of AI agent frameworks, we can now start to think about when they’re used. Specifically, we want to consider some of the core use cases, target personas, and situations where frameworks are an effective option.

We can approach this from a few different angles. 

Firstly, we can consider the use cases for agents more broadly, including automating and replicating decisions, workflows, tasks, and processes that might otherwise require human colleagues to action.

For instance, internal services workflows such as ITSM and HR are popular use cases for AI agents.

The other question is when we would use an agent framework rather than another approach, such as a no-code builder or agentic AI capabilities within domain-specific SaaS tools.

Often, this comes down to the degree of flexibility, control, and scope for customization we require. Frameworks are a strong option in this regard, enabling us to implement agentic functionality within all kinds of hard-coded projects.

This includes new and existing code bases.

As such, agent frameworks are generally utilized by developers or even AI specialists, while other, more visually-focused development tools might be suited to other colleagues and user personas.

## What to look for in an AI agent framework

Lastly, before we begin examining specific examples from across the market for agent frameworks, it’s worth considering the decision points we’re likely to encounter when comparing various options.

That is, while most frameworks offer functionality for achieving similar outcomes, they can nonetheless differ in terms of focus, architecture, and optimization for creating different kinds of solutions.

With that in mind, some of the factors we’ll want to pay attention to include:

- **Core capabilities** - including effectiveness at task decomposition, planning, decision-making, and more.
- **Developer experiences** - how we can interact with the provided elements and components, along with any testing or debugging tools.
- **Integrations** - to be effective, AI agents must be able to integrate with relevant systems, tools, and resources.
- **Language support** - which coding languages are supported by the framework? 
- **Memory** - the tools and functions available to us for handling short-term and long-term memory.
- **Multi-agent capabilities** - coordination and orchestration for multi-agent systems.
- **Oversight, visibility, and monitoring** - for gaining insights into agent behavior and performance.
- **Performance and scalability** - how well an agent framework handles large volumes of tasks.
- **Security features** - measures to protect sensitive data or tools.
- **Ease-of-use** - how easily we can implement a solution with a given framework.
- **Community and support** - the extent of resources or support services that are available to help us implement solutions.

Of course, the specific balance of these factors that we’ll need to prioritize will vary from one project to the next. For instance, in an enterprise context, security will be key, but for small personal projects, we’ll likely be primarily concerned with ease-of-use.

In any case, we can keep these factors in mind as we move on to thinking about specific examples of AI agent frameworks.
