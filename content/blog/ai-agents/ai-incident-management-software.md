Incident management is one of the most critical practices under the umbrella of ITSM and service management more generally. 

This concerns how we identify, analyze, and respond to incidents, such as service interruptions, outages, data loss, physical damage, hardware crashes, unauthorized access, and others.

The goal is to prevent disruptions, minimize costs and risks, and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Of course, like almost all business processes, incident management has been massively impacted by the rise of artificial intelligence. Today, we’re diving deep into this topic by checking out the market for AI incident management tools.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What are AI incident management tools?](#what-are-ai-incident-management-tools)
- [Why implement AI in incident management workflows](#why-implement-ai-in-incident-management-workflows)
- [What to look for in AI incident management software](#what-to-look-for-in-ai-incident-management-software)
- [6 AI incident management tools for 2026](#6-ai-incident-management-tools-for-2026)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What are AI incident management tools?

As the name suggests, AI incident management tools are software systems that enable us to leverage AI within incident management workflows.

As you might expect, this can come in a few different forms. That is, there are a few distinct ways we might want to utilize AI for incident management.

One helpful way to think about this is in terms of the key stages of the incident management process. 

As we mentioned earlier, the first of these is identification. The most obvious way that AI can assist us here is with monitoring. Specifically, there are a range of tools on the market to identify incidents based on data anomalies.

Similarly, within incident reporting workflows, AI can be highly beneficial in the form of natural language processing, helping us to perform a range of tasks, including extracting key information from long-form submissions or providing summaries to human service agents.

To learn more, check out our guide to [AI incident triage](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/ai-incident-triage/).

Of course, many tools also help us to leverage AI within incident responses. In particular, in recent years, the rise of agentic AI has led to substantial changes to the way IT teams automate incident responses.

Specifically, a growing number of teams are implementing agentic systems, capable of independently assessing context and taking actions in response to reported incidents, including both analysis and resolution actions. 

For instance, based on previous resolutions or defined playbooks.

### Why implement AI in incident management workflows

It’s also helpful to think about some of the core benefits of AI incident management. 

Naturally, a huge factor behind the growing adoption here is efficiency savings. That is, AI presents a massive opportunity to reduce the manual administrative workloads required for managing incidents.

For example, AI tools may be able to handle relatively minor or routine incidents more or less autonomously, as well as carrying out crucial tasks for responding to more serious incidents, such as analysis and information-gathering.

As well as reducing the resources incurred by incident management, this is also a powerful way to improve service quality. In particular, AI tools can lead to much faster responses and resolutions, helping to minimize the costs, risks, and service interruptions associated with IT incidents.

Additionally, AI-powered incident management tools offer an effective solution for gaining better oversight of our IT estate, including through proactive monitoring and streamlined incident reporting processes.

This can often mean we’re able to identify incidents earlier, helping both to prevent their occurrence and minimize the impact of incidents when they do occur.

As such, AI incident management tools are a key aspect of how modern IT teams ensure that their service portfolios and ecosystems remain secure, reliable, and effective.

## What to look for in AI incident management software

Before we start looking at some of our specific options from across the market for AI incident management software, it’s also important to have a grasp of the key considerations and decision points we’re likely to encounter when assessing individual platforms.

Incident management is obviously a highly sensitive internal process, as well as being mission-critical, in the sense of helping to maintain continuity and security within our IT ecosystem and across the wider organization.

As such, we might have heightened requirements around security, data management, and other factors.

In the specific case of AI incident management, one critical element to this is how and where our data is stored, processed, and consumed by LLMs. 

For instance, many teams in large organizations have strong preferences for AI automation tools that enable them to handle entire processes within their own environment, including support for on-premises LLMs.

Additionally, effective incident management typically requires extensive integrations with a wide variety of tools across the entire IT estate, including infrastructure, end-user tools, MDM platforms, ITSM tools, SaaS platforms, user management, knowledge sources, and much more.

As such, when assessing individual platforms, we’ll need to be confident that they can securely and reliably integrate with our required tooling.

Lastly, we’ll want to pay close attention to the scope for customization within individual AI incident management tools.

A key aspect to this is the extent to which we can define our own workflows, including defining sequences of steps for resolving specific incidents, escalation rules, and configuring how and when various tools and functions can be triggered by AI-powered systems.

Similarly, the experiences for defining this kind of logic may differ from one platform to the next. For instance, some platforms can offer extensive scope for defining logic via code, while others prioritize visual development experiences.

## 6 AI incident management tools for 2026

Having covered what AI incident management tools are, where they can offer value, and some of the key decision points we’ll want to consider, we can next move on to checking out some of the most prominent solutions for implementing AI in incident management workflows.

As we do so, it’s important to be aware that this is a relatively diverse space, with a few distinct types of platforms that can be used for AI incident management.

Some of the key categories we’ll need to be aware of include AI-powered incident monitoring solutions, wider ITSM platforms with AI capabilities that can be leveraged for managing incidents, and low-code platforms that enable us to leverage AI in a variety of business processes, including incident management.
