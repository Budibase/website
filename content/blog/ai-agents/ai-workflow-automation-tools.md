AI workflow tools are fast becoming a core part of how teams in all industries handle day-to-day workloads.

An unprecedented combination of technological change and pressure on budgets has created a massive level of pressure to adopt AI tools across all sorts of processes.

However, one challenge here is that a huge number of vendors have brought tools to market, aimed at solving this exact problem. Moreover, these often target distinct segments, both in terms of their use cases and ideal users.

So, it can be a real challenge to figure out which specific platform is right for our needs.

Today, we’re tackling this question head-on by diving deep into the market for AI workflow automation tools.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What is AI workflow automation](#what-is-ai-workflow-automation)
- [What do AI workflow tools do?](#what-do-ai-workflow-tools-do?)
- [What to look for in an AI workflow automation platform](#what-to-look-for-in-an-ai-workflow-automation-platform)
- [6 AI workflow management tools for 2025](#6-ai-workflow-management-tools-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is AI workflow automation?

As the name suggests, AI workflow automation means utilizing AI tools within our workflow automation efforts. We can think of a workflow as a defined set of steps that are required to meet a goal, in response to an input or trigger.

This can come in a few different forms, including:

- Enabling an AI system to determine when to trigger defined workflows.
- Using AI tools to action specific steps within a workflow.
- Using AI-powered logic to determine which specific steps are required to complete the individual execution of a workflow.

Importantly, any given AI workflow automation solution might encompass some or all of these elements.

For example, an advanced [AI agentic workflow](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/ai-agentic-workflows/) for IT ticketing might be triggered by a natural language interaction and autonomously determine which actions are required to resolve the user’s issue.

By contrast, a more straightforward automation rule might simply use AI to carry out specific actions within a more strictly deterministic flow. For instance, extracting key values from an invoice that a user has submitted for approval. 

However, while the scope and complexity of AI workflows can vary massively, the overarching goals remain similar. 

That is, enabling us to build efficiency and reliability into our day-to-day operations, including expanding the scope of what we can automate, beyond what might be possible with traditional, deterministic tools.

## What do AI workflow tools do?

So, at a more practical level, how do AI workflow automation tools help us to achieve this? At the highest level, these tools provide reusable, often visual experiences for leveraging AI within workflows, without having to handle this with hard code.

This includes connecting to models, working with prompts, integrating with our wider tool stack, and defining logic to create workflows.

As we hinted at earlier, specific platforms can come in a few different forms.

On the one hand, most traditional workflow builders now offer AI capabilities. This includes built-in steps or nodes for taking specific actions with AI, as well as tools for building agentic logic or creating interfaces to interact with AI workflows.

More recently, low-code AI agent builders have also grown in popularity, offering visual experiences for creating AI systems that are capable of reasoning and performing actions autonomously.

On the other hand, there are more advanced, technical platforms aimed at assisting developers to create sophisticated, highly customized AI workflow solutions. These are often code-based tools and libraries, aimed at expediting custom builds.

Of course, these are only broad distinctions. In reality, individual platforms don’t always fit neatly into one category or another. 

Instead, what this highlights is the breadth of tools that are available, both in terms of ideal use cases and target personas. 

To better understand what this means in practical terms, we can start to think about some of the factors that will shape our decisions around which AI workflow tools are best suited to our individual requirements.

## What to look for in an AI workflow automation platform

As with most software procurement decisions, choosing the right AI workflow automation platform for our needs means dealing with a range of overlapping technical, commercial, and organizational factors.

The most obvious place to start is our technical requirements and usage needs. As we’ve hinted at already, some platforms offer more extensive customization, while others prioritize ease of use for less technical colleagues.

Some of the most prominent factors we’ll want to consider here include:

- **Integration and extensibility** - The degree to which the platform connects with existing systems through APIs, databases, SDKs, or webhooks.
- **AI model compatibility** - The range of AI models or frameworks the platform supports, from hosted APIs to local or custom deployments.
- **Orchestration and scalability** - The platform’s ability to manage complex, stateful, or high-volume workflows across distributed systems.
- **Data handling and governance** - How the platform stores, secures, and manages workflow data, including audit trails and versioning.
- **Developer experience** - The level of control, tooling, and programming flexibility available.
- **Observability and debugging** - The visibility provided into workflow execution, including logs, metrics, and failure tracing.
- **Hosting and deployment** - The available deployment models, such as cloud, on-premise, or hybrid, and how these affect control and compliance.
- **Customization and extensibility** - The extent to which workflows, logic, and components can be adapted or extended beyond built-in functionality.
- **App and UI-building** - Tools that enable us to build end-user solutions for interacting with workflows.

Notably, the specific weight that we give to each of these will vary from one team to the next. For instance, many large organizations will treat self-hosting as a firm requirement, but this may not be a top priority for smaller teams.

Of course, when evaluating new software tools, we’ll also need to pay close attention to commercial issues.

The obvious starting point here is the relative cost of each of our options - both in terms of up-front resources and ongoing maintenance. Key factors here can include licensing costs, support arrangements, and the internal development resources we’ll require.

Notably, many platforms price with very different models, so what’s most cost-effective can be hard to predict.

Another crucial commercial decision point is the actual license terms. Specifically, many teams will want to prioritize open-source AI workflow automation tools, especially where these are going to interact with mission-critical processes, systems, or data.

These are the decisions that we’ll want to keep in mind as we move on to thinking about our specific options for AI workflow automation platforms.
