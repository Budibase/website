Since its launch in 2022, ChatGPT has transformed huge aspects of our daily lives, including in the context of business processes.

However, at a practical level, many organizations still struggle to implement AI tools in a way that drives real value. Part of the issue here is that, while hugely powerful, ChatGPT isn’t always the exact right fit for the needs of large, security-conscious organizations.

Today, we’re exploring one important element of this by checking out the market for open-source ChatGPT alternatives.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What is ChatGPT?](what-is-chatgpt)
- [Why would you want an open-source ChatGPT alternative?](#why-would-you-want-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative)
- [What to look for in an open-source ChatGPT alternative](#what-to-look-for-in-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative)
- [5 open-source ChatGPT alternatives for 2025](#5-open-source-chatgpt-alternatives-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT probably doesn’t need much introduction. It’s OpenAI’s flagship AI chat tool. This is not to be confused with the underlying language models that power it, which are currently on the GPT-5 family of LLMs.

It’s built around a conversational interface, which enables users to submit queries and questions via natural language prompts. The model then interprets these before generating responses based on its training data, as well as web-based sources.

Because of this, it has quickly become a ubiquitous part of how users interact with information online, including taking a large slice of usage away from traditional search.

In a professional context, huge numbers of workers also use ChatGPT’s generative capabilities for tasks such as drafting copy, editing emails, writing code, and more. ChatGPT’s more advanced models can even generate images and videos.

Many teams also leverage ChatGPT as part of their workflow automation efforts. This can come in a few different configurations. 

One is utilizing `Custom GPTs`, which are essentially versions of ChatGPT that can be tweaked and customized with specific knowledge, instructions, and capabilities.

Another is utilizing ChatGPT via API connections. This enables us to use ChatGPT within structured workflow automations in a consistent, rules-based manner. For instance, making a call to OpenAI’s API to perform a specific function within a wider workflow.

Recently, OpenAI also introduced ChatKit, which enables teams to build agentic experiences within ChatGPT, including leveraging tool use and embedded UI components within chats.

Alternatively, many AI tools within use-case-specific business platforms are themselves powered by ChatGPT. 

For example, ticketing bots within many ITSM platforms.

To support business usage, ChatGPT also offers a range of capabilities for enterprise users, including SSO, data encryption, domain verification, admin tools, and preventing company data from being used in model training.

## Why would you want an open-source ChatGPT alternative?

However, as we hinted at earlier, many large organizations have additional requirements that might preclude them from using ChatGPT internally - especially around how they store, process, and control data.

At the same time, IT teams in these kinds of companies are under pressure to provide similar capabilities to their colleagues, often due to widespread usage of ChatGPT outside of IT’s governance and control.

For these kinds of teams, open-source ChatGPT alternatives offer a clear path forward.

One of the key issues here is controlling how and where data is stored. 

ChatGPT offers enterprise users the option to prevent their data from being used to train models, but many teams need to go further than this by utilizing open-source models that can be hosted on their own infrastructure.

This is especially important if the chat tool we implement is going to interact with mission critical data, which already has tight hosting requirements.

Additionally, there are several key operational reasons that we might prioritize an open-source ChatGPT alternative.

One is that these kinds of platforms often offer a high level of configuration, enabling us to closely tailor our solution to our specific requirements in terms of existing workflows.

On top of this, there are commercial factors, such as ongoing cost management and the need to avoid vendor lock-in.

## What to look for in an open-source ChatGPT alternative

Understanding why we might prioritize open-source options, we can next move on to thinking about the specific decision points we’re likely to encounter when choosing a specific platform.

Firstly, it’s important to note that these types of solutions don’t always take the form of off-the-shelf, ready-to-use tools in the way that ChatGPT itself or COTS alternatives do.

Instead, we can think about these in two broad clusters:

- **Chat and agent frameworks** - developer-oriented toolkits and libraries, offering reusable elements to help teams build custom solutions.
- **Modular chat platforms** - offering pre-built solutions for some elements of our chat experience, while still retaining configurability. For instance, a ready-to-use chat UI and integration layer that we can connect our own model and tools to.

However, rather than being a clear distinction, specific platforms often exist on a spectrum between these two clusters.

Therefore, it’s still vital to understand the underlying decision points that could sway us towards one option or another.

Perhaps the biggest thing here is balancing the extent of customization available with how quickly and easily we can output a working solution. For instance, can we build our internal chatbot with visual tools, or will we require extensive development skills?

On top of this, we’ll likely want to consider:



- **Security and governance** - The ability to enforce authentication, RBAC, encryption, and data residency controls.
- **Integration depth** - How easily the platform connects with APIs, automation tools, and data stores.
- **Customization and extensibility** - The extent to which we can modify prompts, logic, and connected tools.
- **Ease of implementation** - How quickly a viable chatbot can be deployed.
- **Scalability and performance** - How well the system handles concurrency, data load, and latency.
- **Community maturity and support** - The activity level of contributors, plugin ecosystems, and documentation quality.
- **Operational cost** - Infrastructure, maintenance, and personnel overheads relative to equivalent commercial solutions.
- **Enterprise pricing** - While open-source solutions can be used for free, most platforms also charge for support and services, as well as certain premium features that we’ll need for enterprise usage.

Importantly, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach here.

Instead, in order to effectively vet and assess our options, we’ll need to have a clear idea of how each of these factors plays into our own specific requirements, in order to choose the most appropriate open-source ChatGPT alternative for our needs.
