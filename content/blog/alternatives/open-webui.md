+++

As AI becomes an increasingly prevalent part of day-to-day life, more and more businesses are prioritizing solutions that enable them to leverage their own data and models securely.

The key issue here is that we often can’t simply allow users to send company data to publicly available AI services. At the same time, without implementing similar capabilities, it can be hard to stop employees from using AI tools as a form of shadow IT.

Today, we’re diving deep into one of the most prominent open-source tools for creating custom conversational AI solutions on top of a variety of models and data by checking out the top alternatives to Open WebUI.

A growing number of vendors are bringing tools to market aimed at empowering teams to ship UIs and workflows on top of a variety of LLMs. 

To better understand this space, we’ll be covering:

- [Why would you need an alternative to Open WebUI](#why-would-you-need-an-alternative-to-open-webui)
- [What to look for in an Open WebUI alternative](#what-to-look-for-in-an-open-webui-alternative)
- [6 Open WebUI alternatives](#6-open-webui-alternatives)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is Open WebUI?

Open WebUI is an open-source, self-hosted platform that provides an interface layer for interacting with LLMs.

(Open WebUI Website)

This includes a ready-to-use [chat UI](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-chat-uis/), complete with chat histories, prompt editing, and support for a range of LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs.

On top of this, it offers a range of features to help us create more advanced AI solutions, including a built-in inference engine for performing RAG tasks, as well as handling tools, functions, and authentication.

The goal is to provide a reusable, streamlined experience for creating secure AI-powered systems that we can run on our own infrastructure, without needing to build core aspects of this from scratch.

Essentially, this enables us to implement custom chat-based solutions that are optimized for our own internal use cases and don’t compromise on key security requirements.

For example, creating chat assistants that can retrieve information from company knowledge sources or trigger internal workflows and processes via connected systems.

Notably, as an open-source solution, Open WebUI offers a high degree of flexibility and customization, compared to chatbot solutions that are more focused on offering a fully off-the-shelf solution.

## Why would you need an alternative to Open WebUI?

Open WebUI is probably the best-known solution of its kind that’s available today. However, this does not necessarily mean that it’s the most suitable option for all possible scenarios or use cases.

The most obvious component to this is our actual functional requirements. That is, we may need specific capabilities that Open WebUI doesn’t offer, but other platforms do.

For example, Open WebUI is generally focused on creating chat-based solutions, while other platforms might offer this on top of a fuller suite of capabilities for creating end-user apps, workflow automations, or other solutions leveraging LLMs.

Additionally, some platforms are better optimized for leveraging conversational experiences within specific use cases and teams. For instance, if we want to build an ITSM assistant, several platforms exist that offer specific integrations for common IT tools.

Lastly, we’ll need to consider user experiences. On the one hand, less technical users might find that certain other platforms are a better fit for their needs, offering more ease of configuration. 

At the same time, developers who want a more customizable solution might find that other platforms offer a greater degree of flexibility and control compared to Open WebUI.

## What to look for in an Open WebUI alternative

Understanding some of the high-level issues that might sway us towards an alternative to Open WebUI, we can move on to the specific considerations that will help us determine which platform best suits our needs.

As with any software procurement decision, this touches on a range of considerations across technical, commercial, and operational factors.

- **Ease of setup and hosting** - How quickly it can be deployed and whether it runs locally, in the cloud, or as a managed service.
- **Supported integrations** - Availability of built-in connectors for common tools and APIs to reduce manual setup.
- **Interface design and user focus** - Whether it’s built for developers, end users, or teams with mixed technical skills.
- **Collaboration features** - Support for shared workspaces, multi-user access, and version tracking.
- **Workflow and automation** - Ability to build step-by-step processes or trigger actions beyond simple chat.
- **Model and backend options** - Compatibility with multiple model providers or self-hosted backends.
- **Security and access control** - Options for authentication, permissions, and data protection.
- **Extensibility** - APIs, plugins, or scripting support for future customization.
- **Commercial factors** - Licensing terms, pricing models, and long-term sustainability of the platform or vendor.

Importantly, the relative importance of each of these factors will vary from one team to the next. 

For example, the importance we place on features like security, integration options, or collaboration tools might be greater in larger organizations compared to smaller teams or personal projects.

Similarly, the extent of customization that’s available is obviously an important concern, but at the same time, this has to be balanced with appropriate experiences for our users, as well as the development resources we have available for implementation.
