Formstack is a popular form-building platform, offering extensive capabilities for creating custom data collection tools, as well as functionality for generating documents, handling signatures, automating workflows, and more.

However, the market for form builder tools is relatively diverse, with a range of vendors targeting distinct segments, end users, and use cases.

So, it can often be difficult to determine which platform is right for your specific needs.

Today, we’re taking one angle on this question, by checking out some of the most prominent FormStack alternatives that are available on the market today.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What is Formstack?](#what-is-formstack)
  - [Who uses Formstack?](#who-uses-formstack)
- [Why would you look for a Formstack alternative?](#why-would-you-look-for-a-formstack-alternative)
- [6 Formstack alternatives for 2025](#6-formstack-alternatives-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is Formstack?

Part of the wider Intellistack, Formstack is a comprehensive no-code platform for building forms and managing workflows.

As such, it offers a range of capabilities to enable users to create professional forms and other workflow tools, with a comparatively low requirement in terms of technical skills and expertise.

This centers around an intuitive builder for creating forms. In particular, it’s highly suited to more advanced form use cases, with capabilities including form prefill, extensive customization and styling options, a huge range of integration options, enterprise security, and more.

In particular, Formstack is a strong offering for teams that need to handle wider workflows that involve form submissions. So, we can create comprehensive automation logic when forms are submitted, including grouped approvals.

Formstack is also one of the more powerful platforms in this space when it comes to document-based workflows, offering both automated document generation and electronic signatures.

There are even dedicated form and document capabilities for Salesforce.

On top of this, Formstack offers a range of built-in AI capabilities, including tools for touchless form generation, making it a great fit for teams that want to output professional forms with minimal effort.

### Who uses Formstack?

Formstack has the potential to be a good option for a range of different types of companies. We can consider this from a few different perspectives.

In terms of target personas, Formstack could be suitable for a range of types of users. Specifically, as a no-code option, it can easily be used to empower non-technical colleagues to output custom forms for their own purposes.

At the same time, more technical colleagues, including IT teams, can still benefit from using Formstack as an efficient, expedited platform for creating forms.

Formstack is also used by a wide range of different types of organizations. On the one hand, it offers a range of pricing options that could be suitable for SMEs and mid-market companies. On the other, there’s also enterprise-grade security and other capabilities for larger organizations.

In terms of specific industries, Formstack is particularly popular in instances where there are heightened security needs, as well as extensive admin workloads. For instance, the government, healthcare, insurance, finance, and education sectors.

It’s also popular for a range of internal and external-facing use cases, across IT, sales, HR, and other verticals.

## Why would you look for a Formstack alternative?

Before we start examining some of our options for Formstack alternatives, it’s important to think through some of the key reasons that we might find it unsuitable for our particular needs.

After all, as with any type of software procurement decision, it’s unlikely that any single platform could be ideally suited to every business’s requirements.

With form builders in particular, one thing to be conscious of is that individual vendors target their platforms at distinct corners of the market. Some are more streamlined, while others offer more advanced customization options, potentially even facilitating custom code.

So, on the one hand, we might opt for another platform on the basis that it offers a specific piece of functionality which Formstack does not. Alternatively, we might determine that Formstack’s feature set is excessive for our needs, and a simpler platform would suit us better.

This can be further complicated by pricing. Individual vendors might generally provide similar platforms, but still price them differently. This largely relates to the specific feature and usage limitations that are imposed across different pricing tiers.

As such, it’s possible that a platform that is cost-effective for one team might be prohibitively expensive for another, depending on their more granular requirements.

Lastly, Formstack is a closed-source platform and can’t be self-hosted. So, if there are firm requirements, we may need to look elsewhere.

## 6 Formstack alternatives for 2025

As we’ve noted already, the market for form builders is diverse, with individual vendors optimizing their platforms for a range of target users and use cases.

To reflect this, we’ve chosen a range of different Formstack alternatives, which are suitable for a range of personas and applications.

Specifically, our picks are:

1. [Budibase](#1-budibase)
2. [TypeForm](#2-typeform)
3. [JotForm](#3-jotform)
4. [Formbricks](#4-formbricks)
5. [SurveyMonkey](#5-surveymonkey)
6. [Google Forms](#6-google-forms)

Let’s check each one out in turn.

### 1. Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action. With extensive external data support, autogenerated UIs, powerful automations, and more, it’s the ideal tool for building advanced, secure forms.

![Budibase](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Budibase_Form_Builder_ki7pb1.webp "Budibase")

#### Features

Budibase offers leading support for external data, with dedicated connectors for a range of RDBMSs, NoSQL tools, APIs, and spreadsheets, alongside our built-in low-code database. Budibase acts as a proxy, querying external data without ever storing it.

Once we’ve set up our data layer, Budibase empowers us to automatically generate forms and CRUD UIs. We can then extensively customize these, with optional JavaScript and CSS, a library of reusable components, flexible conditionality rules, and much more.

Budibase is ideal for complex data collection workflows, offering an intuitive visual automation builder, including a range of configurable triggers, actions, and LLM operations, alongside branching and looping logic.

{{< form-builder-cta >}}

#### Use cases

Budibase is ideally suited for IT teams who need to build secure forms in large organizations, offering optional self-hosting, free SSO, custom RBAC, air-gapped deployments, and a whole host of other security tools.

In particular, our platform is optimized for building professional forms on top of existing data, with minimal custom code.

On top of this, with Budibase’s flexible UI and automation builders, it’s perfect for all kinds of follow-on workflows from form submissions, including building internal tools, approval apps, admin panels, dashboards, portals, ticketing systems, and much more.

Take a look at our [features overview](https://budibase.com/product/) to learn more.

#### Pricing

Budibase offers highly scalable pricing, designed to deliver exceptional value for all kinds of use cases. You can build as many apps as you want for free, for up to five users in the cloud, or twenty if you self-host.

Paid plans start from $5 per month for end users and $50 for app creators, as well as introducing custom branding, reusable code snippets, synchronous automations, Budibase AI, and much more.

Custom enterprise licenses are also available, including creator-only pricing, providing air-gapped deployments, enforceable SSO, PWAs, SCIM, audit logs, and other enterprise functionality.

Check out our [pricing page](https://budibase.com/pricing/) to learn more.

### 2. TypeForm

TypeForm is another one of the most ubiquitous form builders on the market, offering intuitive experiences for creating highly attractive, professional forms, surveys, quizzes, apps, landing pages, and other data collection tools.

![TypeForm](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736004/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/TypeForm_vwjhdd.webp "TypeForm") (TypeForm Website)

#### Pros

A large part of TypeForm’s popularity relates to how quickly and easily we can create professional form UIs. It offers a modern drag-and-drop experience for creating attractive multi-step form UIs.

On top of this, TypeForm has introduced a range of AI capabilities, including the ability to output working forms from natural language inputs, as well as tools for suggesting survey questions and analyzing response data.

Like Formstack, TypeForm offers a high level of enterprise readiness, including a variety of integration options for common business software platforms.

#### Cons

One potential downside of TypeForm is that it’s fairly opinionated in terms of the form UIs we can create. While these look great, they might not be the most suitable look and feel for all use cases.

Like most form builder tools, TypeForm also offers somewhat limited capabilities for working with external databases. So, we can send form data to a SQL database, but we’ll need to rely on an intermediary tool such as Zapier to do so.

Again, like many other Formstack alternatives, TypeForm offers limited flexibility for editing our form and underlying table schemas independently of one another, which may be an unfamiliar experience for developers.

#### Pricing

TypeForm’s pricing utilizes fixed tiers with limitations on internal users and monthly form responses. Paid licenses start from $25 per month for a single user and 100 responses. These scale to $83 for five users and 10,000 responses.

Custom enterprise pricing is available to go beyond these limits, as well as to access premium features such as custom domains, custom branding, or SSO.

TypeForm also offers specific license types for marketing or HR teams. Each of these offers its own use-case-specific feature sets, with fixed or custom licenses available within each vertical.

### 3. JotForm

Next, we have JotForm. This is likely one of the best-known form builder tools on the market today, making it an important Formstack alternative for us to be aware of.

![JotForm Fromstack Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/JotForm_rztftd.webp "JotForm Formstack Alternatives")

(JotForm Website)

#### Pros

JotForm offers a highly impressive combination of flexibility and ease of use. In particular, it offers an incredibly intuitive, modern UI for building forms in minutes. There’s also a huge library of templates to help us get started with a variety of use cases.

Besides this, JotForm offers extensive advanced functionality for building forms. This includes a range of integration options, support for handling payment details, a range of customization and styling options, and a workflow automation builder.

Similarly, JotForm offers capabilities for building a wider range of solutions, beyond just forms. This includes tools for creating custom apps, interactive data tables, ecommerce stores, AI agents, and more.

#### Cons

As a more feature-rich platform, some teams might find that a more lightweight solution for building forms suits their needs better.

Many users note that important functionality is restricted to the most expensive pricing tiers, which can make JotForm less viable for building a smaller number of forms with advanced features.

Again, we’ll need to use an intermediary tool such as Zapier if we want to send form data to a SQL database, although this is the case with most Formstack competitors.

#### Pricing

JotForm offers several pricing tiers, based largely on usage. We can build up to five forms for free, with a single user and 100 monthly submissions.

Paid plans start at $34 per month for 25 forms and 1,000 submissions, ranging up to $99 for 100 forms and 1,0000 submissions.

To overcome these limits or access features such as multiple internal users, SSO, or custom branding and domains, we’ll need an Enterprise license. So, JotForm may not be affordable if we only need to build a small number of forms with these more advanced capabilities.

Take a look at our guide to the top [JotForm alternatives](https://budibase.com/blog/alternatives/jotform/).

### 4. Formbricks

Next, we have Formbricks. This is a slightly different proposition in the market for Formstack alternatives, as an open-source survey builder and experience management platform.

![FormBricks](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Formbricks_t2kpbg.webp "FormBricks")(Formbricks Website)

#### Pros

One clear benefit of Formbricks is that it’s an open-source and self-hostable platform, unlike many of the more traditional form builders we’ve seen. This could make it a good fit for use cases where we need more control over how and where our forms are hosted.

Whether we self-host or not, Formbricks is a highly feature-rich survey platform. It offers an intuitive builder with extensive options for applying custom styling, designs, and logic within our surveys.

It also offers more specific CX functionality that we won’t see in most traditional form builders, including in-app surveys and advanced segmentation options.

#### Cons

One thing that’s worth noting is that Formbricks might not be the most appropriate option if we primarily want a more traditional form builder, as it’s generally optimized for its own specific use cases. So, we might want to look elsewhere for more general form-building.

Some aspects of the platform also feel like they could be suitable for a more technical user base than certain other platforms, with some users noting that they could benefit from some development knowledge to get the most out of the platform.

As we’ll see in a second, some teams might find pricing for the cloud platform a little more restrictive than some other platforms in terms of usage limits.

#### Pricing

Formbricks offers distinct pricing for its cloud and self-hosted platforms. The free plan in the cloud offers us unlimited surveys, with 1,000 monthly responses and 2,000 contacts. The free community edition does not list any usage restrictions, and offers extensive functionality.

Paid plans for the cloud product start at $49 per month for 5,000 monthly responses and 7,500 contacts, along with custom branding, attribute-based targeting, and other premium features.

Custom enterprise pricing is available for both the cloud and self-hosted platforms.

### 5. SurveyMonkey

As the name suggests, SurveyMonkey is another survey builder tool. It’s a well-known platform for creating professional surveys and forms, which is especially popular among large enterprises.

![SurveyMonkey](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/SurveyMonkey_w6z3dp.webp "SurveyMonkey") (SurveyMonkey Website)

#### Pros

SurveyMonkey is an impressive platform for building professional surveys without requiring custom code. This includes a visual builder, extensive templates, and even AI capabilities for outputting surveys or suggesting questions.

It’s also particularly strong for analytics capabilities. SurveyMonkey offers powerful custom dashboards, as well as a range of statistical tools, including AI-powered tools for extracting insights from survey responses.

There’s also a highly customizable standalone form builder, which opens SurveyMonkey to a wider range of use cases beyond surveys.

#### Cons

Like many of the other tools we’ve seen, we’ll need to use an integration platform such as Zapier or a third-party SurveyMonkey app if we want to interact with SQL databases.

Although SurveyMonkey enables us to build highly attractive forms and surveys, some users note that it might not offer as extensive design customization as some other platforms.

SurveyMonkey’s free plan is limited to 25 responses, so it likely won’t be usable for anything but the simplest use cases.

#### Pricing

SurveyMonkey can be a cost-effective platform, with team plans starting from $30 per user per month. Individual plans bill at $39 per user per month, with unlimited surveys and up to 15,000 responses per year.

However, in terms of feature restrictions across pricing tiers, SurveyMonkey can be more restrictive. For instance, on individual plans, we’ll need a Premier license, at $139 per month for custom branding.

We’ll need an enterprise license for certain important features, including SSO.

### 6. Google Forms

Lastly, we have Google Forms. Part of the wider Workspace platform, this is perhaps the best-known solution for outputting simple data collection UIs.

![Google Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Google_Workspace_gedssx.webp "Google Forms")(Google Forms Website)

#### Pros

One of Google Forms’ biggest selling points is that it can largely be used for free. Because of this, it’s incredibly widely used, including for a huge range of personal projects and business workflows.

It’s also incredibly easy to use, offering a form-building experience that will be familiar and intuitive to almost all users. 

Forms also offers more advanced capabilities, including a range of security measures, as well as close integration with the wider Workspace ecosystem, making it easy for us to interact with submitted data in Google Sheets or Apps Script.

#### Cons

However, there are important downsides to Google Forms, too. For one thing, it’s highly opinionated design-wise. So, we have options for customization and styling, but Google Forms still have an unmistakable look about them.

On top of this, we may need to use Apps Script or Google Forms’ library of plugins for more advanced use cases that some other platforms would be able to handle comparatively easily.

Additionally, since Google Forms is intended to work alongside the wider Workspace ecosystem, it could be a less attractive option for teams that don’t use this in their existing business operations.

#### Pricing

As we said earlier, Google Forms is free to use, without specific limitations on the number of forms we can build or submissions we can process.

However, this also means that we can’t purchase a separate license for just this platform. Instead, in order to access key business features, we’ll need to purchase a wider Workspace license.

So, this could be a great pick for a simple Formstack alternative for teams already using Google tools, but may not be the most attractive choice for teams who do not.

## Turn data into action with Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action.

With huge external data support, autogenerated UIs, a powerful visual automation editor, extensive AI capabilities, free SSO, custom RBAC, optional self-hosting, and more, there’s never been a better way to build secure, advanced forms.
