TypeForm is one of the most popular form builder tools on the market today, owing in large part to its intuitive, streamlined experiences for creating professional data collection UIs.

However, this is a relatively crowded space, with several notable vendors targeting specific types of use cases and end users.

Today, we’re checking out an important angle on form builders, by checking out some of the most prominent TypeForm alternatives on the market today.

Specifically, we’ll start by examining where TypeForm sits in the market, including:

- [What is TypeForm?](#what-is-typeform)
  - [Who uses TypeForm?](#who-uses-typeform)
- [Why would we look for a TypeForm alternative?](#why-would-we-look-for-a-typeform-alternative)
- [6 TypeForm alternatives for 2025](#6-typeform-alternatives-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is TypeForm?

TypeForm is a cloud-based, no-code tool for building forms, surveys, quizzes, polls, landing pages, and other types of data collection UIs.

![TypeForm Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736004/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/TypeForm_vwjhdd.webp "TypeForm Alternatives") (TypeForm Website)

The goal is to provide teams with a fast, easy way to build professional forms without requiring extensive technical skill or knowledge.

In particular, TypeForm is a popular option for creating external-facing forms, offering attractive designs alongside a range of integration options, distribution tools, automations, and reporting capabilities.

More recently, TypeForm has also released key AI functionality, including co-pilot tools for builders, adaptive follow-up questions for end-users, and analytics to extract a host of qualitative and quantitative insights from form data.

For workflow automations, TypeForm offers an intuitive, visual builder, complete with branching logic, making the platform as a whole a good fit for more advanced form-building use cases, including adding lead scoring, calculations, or other automation rules.

### Who uses TypeForm?

As we noted a second ago, a huge part of TypeForm’s draw is the ability to create attractive, highly functional forms quickly and without custom code.

This makes it a viable option for a range of different types of teams and colleagues.

One important cohort here is non-technical colleagues in business-level departments. For example, TypeForm is highly popular for product, marketing, HR, CS, and other external-facing use cases.

The value-add here is enabling these colleagues to build the form solutions they need without burdening IT.

Additionally, IT teams can naturally also benefit from a streamlined, expedited way to build forms for their colleagues in other departments.

TypeForm is also popular with a range of different types of organizations. So, the platform’s scalable pricing can make it suitable for SMEs that need an affordable solution for building forms.

At the same time, it offers enterprise security features and capabilities, making it viable for use in large organizations too.

## Why would we look for a TypeForm alternative?

Before we start looking at some of the specific TypeForm alternatives we might opt for, it’s worth considering some of the factors that are likely to drive this decision.

Firstly, it’s worth noting that different platforms in this space are targeted at distinct segments. For instance, some tools offer greater degrees of flexibility and customization, while others are more focused on making it quick and easy to output simple forms.

So, some users may decide that TypeForm lacks specific capabilities that are required for their use case, while others may feel that the functionality on offer in TypeForm is excessive for their needs.

Of course, another key variable here is pricing. As we said a second ago, TypeForm can be a relatively affordable platform, but comparing like-for-like across different vendors can also be somewhat tricky.

The issue here is that individual vendors have their own models for pricing, often with very different limitations on usage or functionality across their license tiers.

Because of this, TypeForm may not be the most cost-effective option for specific teams and use cases, causing us to seek out an alternative.

## 6 TypeForm alternatives for 2025

With a better grasp of what TypeForm is, who uses it, and why we might seek out an alternative platform, we can start thinking about some of the other prominent form builders on the market today.

Specifically, our chosen TypeForm alternatives for 2025 are:

1. [Budibase](#1-budibase)
2. [JotForm](#2-jotform)
3. [Formbricks](#3-formbricks)
4. [Tally](#4-tally)
5. [Formstack](#5-formstack)
6. [Wufoo Forms](#6-wufoo-forms)

Let’s take each one in turn.

### 1. Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action. Security-focused teams in all industries choose Budibase to build advanced forms on top of just about any type of data.

![Budibase](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Budibase_Form_Builder_ki7pb1.webp "Budibase")

#### Features

Budibase offers leading connectivity for external data sources, with connectors for a huge range of RDBMSs, NoSQL tools, APIs, and Google Sheets, alongside our built-in low-code database, with support for CSV imports.

Once we’ve connected our data, we can autogenerate highly customizable forms and CRUD UIs. Budibase is ideal for advanced form use cases, including optional custom JavaScript and CSS, conditional UIs, complex filtering rules, and much more.

Budibase also offers a visual workflow automation editor, complete with branching and looping logic, alongside a range of configurable triggers, actions, and LLM operations, making it perfect for handling complex processes involving form inputs.

#### Use cases

Budibase is the smart choice for building secure forms. With free SSO, optional self-hosting, custom RBAC, and much more, security-first teams around the world trust our platform to handle their sensitive data.

It’s also the ideal choice for complex form use cases, including a huge range of field types, dynamic variables, conditionality rules, and complete flexibility around your back-end database schema.

Budibase users choose our platform to power end-to-end workflows, including everything that happens after a form is submitted. For instance, building internal tools, approval apps, CRUD UIs, admin panels, dashboards, portals, ticketing systems, and much more.

Check out our [features overview](https://budibase.com/product/) to learn more.

#### Pricing

Budibase offers highly scalable pricing for teams of all sizes. You can build as many apps as you need for up to five authenticated users in the cloud, or twenty if you self-host.

Paid plans start from $5 per month for end users and $50 for creators. This also introduces premium features, including Budibase AI, custom branding, reusable code snippets, PDF generation, synchronous automations, and more.

Custom enterprise pricing is also available, complete with air-gapped deployments, enforceable SSO, PWA support, and more. Check out our [pricing page](https://budibase.com/pricing/) to learn more.

### 2. JotForm

JotForm is perhaps the most prominent TypeForm alternative, owing to its sizeable market share in the form builder space. It also offers extensive capabilities for building data tables, apps, ecommerce sites, AI agents, and fillable PDFs.

![JotForm TypeForm Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/JotForm_rztftd.webp "JotForm TypeForm Alternatives")

(JotForm Website)

#### Pros

A large part of JotForm’s popularity comes down to its modern, user-friendly experience for building forms. With thousands of templates and an intuitive drag-and-drop editor, we can create professional form UIs incredibly quickly.

JotForm is also one of the more feature-rich form builders on the market, with a huge range of integration options, extensive styling and customization, support for collecting payment information, a workflow automation builder, and more.

Similarly, with extensive capabilities for creating wider solutions, including custom apps and data management tools, JotForm could be a great fit for a range of teams with more complex needs, beyond simple form building.

#### Cons

As is the case with many prominent form builder tools, one important limitation with JotForm is that we can’t directly connect to external SQL databases. Instead, to do this, we’ll need to rely on an intermediary tool, such as Zapier or Make.

Additionally, some teams that want a more lightweight form-building solution may find that JotForm offers a lot of functionality that they don’t realistically need.

Despite being generally well-rated for ease of use, some users also report that they find JotForm a little bit confusing when trying to create more complex forms.

#### Pricing

JotForm’s pricing has the potential to be quite scalable, with several fixed tiers based on the number of forms and monthly submissions we need to manage. There’s a working free tier with five forms and 100 monthly submissions.

Fixed paid plans start from $34 per month for 25 forms and 1,000 submissions, ranging up to $99 a month for 100 forms and 10,000 submissions.

Custom enterprise pricing is also available, introducing important functionality like multi-user accounts, payment submissions, API usage, SSO, and more.

### 3. Formbricks

Next, we have Formbricks. This occupies a slightly different corner of the market for TypeForm alternatives, being primarily focused on survey building and customer experience management.

![FormBricks](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Formbricks_t2kpbg.webp "FormBricks")(Formbricks Website)

#### Pros

One of the big selling points of Formbricks is the ease with which we can output professional surveys. In particular, it offers a range of customization options for styling, design, logic, and more, in an intuitive visual builder.

Formbricks is a strong choice for more advanced form use cases, including complex logic, calculation fields, and more. There’s even specific functionality for product teams to create in-app surveys.

Unlike many other solutions in this space, Formbricks is also open-source and self-hostable, making it a great choice for security-conscious teams that need a feature-rich TypeForm alternative.

#### Cons

One potential downside of Formbricks is that, as a platform primarily aimed at survey and experience management, some teams might find that more straightforward form builders suit their needs better.

For example, if we don’t need these more advanced capabilities.

Additionally, some aspects of the platform feel as though they’re aimed at slightly more technical users. For instance, some users note that some knowledge of development will be helpful for tasks such as creating custom integrations.

#### Pricing

Formbricks prices its cloud and self-hosted platforms separately. There are free versions of both, with limitations on monthly contacts, responses, and projects in the free cloud version.

Paid plans in the cloud start from $49 per month, for 5,000 responses and 7,500 contacts, along with other features such as custom branding and attribute-based targeting.

Custom enterprise licenses are also available for both the cloud and self-hosted platforms.

### 4. Tally

Next up, we have Tally Forms. This is a somewhat unique offering in the form builder market, with an intuitive document editor-style experience.

![Tally Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Tally_xzaatj.webp "Tally Forms")(Tally Website)

#### Pros

Tally enables us to create and edit forms in much the same way we would edit a Word document or page on a CMS. This can make it particularly accessible to a wide range of less-technical builders.

It offers a range of input blocks for simple data types, as well as handling payment details, visual rankings, and other data.

Tally also offers more advanced capabilities such as answer piping, conditional logic, calculations, and hidden fields.

#### Cons

Despite being popular, Tally’s novel UI won’t be for everyone. For instance, when it comes to building logic, some users might prefer a more visual approach, like we’d get in other TypeForm alternatives.

Some users also note that analytics and reporting capabilities may be more extensive in some other platforms.

Lastly, Tally is one of the platforms we’ve seen so far that could most strictly be thought of as a standalone form builder. So, we may want to look elsewhere for more comprehensive functionality.

#### Pricing

We can create as many forms as we like with Tally, for free. Naturally, this could make it a very attractive option for many teams.

Paid licenses start from $24 per month, with important features such as custom branding and domains, custom CSS, email notifications, and form visit analytics.

Business licenses bill at $74 per month, enabling us to control data retention, verify emails, and manage forms’ version histories.

### 5. Formstack

Part of the wider Intellistack ecosystem, Formstack is a no-code form builder aimed at creating professional data collection tools within a wide range of business workflows. 

![FormStack](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736004/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/FormStack_veldmy.webp "FormStack") (FormStack Website)

#### Pros

Many users choose Formstack for its high level of versatility and configurability. In particular, we can utilize it in a range of workflows, including using prefilled links, conditional logic, or automated approval flows.

Formstack is also a highly attractive option for teams that need forms that can handle document management workflows. For instance, it offers digital signatures and document generation, facilitating a whole range of admin workflows.

Users also regard Formstack highly for its breadth of integration options for common business tools. In particular, it offers close integration with the Salesforce platform, which could be a massive benefit if our wider operations already utilize this.

#### Cons

However, like all platforms, Formstack is not without its potential downsides and limitations. One of the common complaints here, compared to some other TypeForm alternatives, is that Formstack may not offer as extensive design customization options.

Some users also note that Formstack can present a somewhat steep learning curve and may not be as intuitive as some other form builder tools.

Like most other form builder tools, we’ll need to utilize Zapier or another intermediary if we want to send submitted data to a SQL database.

#### Pricing

Formstack’s minimum pricing is a little bit more expensive than some of the other platforms we’ve seen. Licenses start from $82 per month for a single builder, 25 forms, with 1,000 responses each.

We’ll need a Suite plan at $250 for three users and 100 forms to access important functionality, such as workflow automations.

Custom enterprise pricing is also available. There are also dedicated licenses for Salesforce use cases or managing document workflows, with their own distinct tiers of features and usage restrictions.

### 6. Wufoo Forms

Lastly, we have Wufoo Forms. This is a standalone form builder that offers a strong combination of design customization and streamlined experiences for configuring forms.

![Wufoo Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Wufoo_Forms_rffxeu.webp "Wufoo Forms") (Wufoo Website)

#### Pros

Wufoo is a popular choice for teams that want a relatively minimalist tool for building forms. This comprises a drag-and-drop interface for adding and configuring a range of fields, along with conditional logic, page breaks, and other tools.

With the structure of our forms in place, we can apply a pre-built theme or create our own using Wufoo’s Theme Builder. This allows us to alter key elements such as color schemes or fonts.

There are also tools for creating custom reports and dashboards based on our form submission data, making Wufoo a good fit for workflows that require analysis of our form data.

#### Cons

One common complaint about Wufoo is that its UI looks and feels fairly dated. It’s perfectly functional, but it may not be as modern or attractive as some other platforms.

Similarly, while Wufoo is easy to use, it might be comparatively difficult to create professional-looking forms using the Theme Designer. So, there’s a good level of customization on offer, but many other form builders will look better straight out of the box.

Again, we can’t connect directly to SQL databases without utilizing Zapier or another integration platform.

#### Pricing

Wufoo is a relatively affordable option for a TypeForm alternative. There’s a working free tier, offering a single user, ten forms, and 1,000 combined responses. However, we can’t password-protect free forms.

Paid plans offer unlimited forms, with limits on internal users and total submissions. These start at $33.25 per month for five users and 10,000 submissions.

For $83.25 per month, we get 20 users and $210.25 for 60. Additionally, it’s worth pointing out that Wufoo’s paid plans mostly have feature parity. 

## Turn data into action with Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action. 

With connectivity for a huge range of external data sources, autogenerated forms and CRUD UIs, powerful AI-driven automations, optional self-hosting, custom RBAC, free SSO, and more, there’s never been a better way to build secure, professional forms.
