Google Forms is probably the most ubiquitous form builder tool available today, offering an intuitive, flexible platform for creating custom data collection UIs.

However, this is a fairly crowded market, with a range of different vendors targeting distinct segments, including in terms of their primary users, use cases, and other aspects of their market positioning. 

Therefore, in order to make an informed decision about the right form builder for your needs, we need to have a clear picture of what our options are, as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses.

Today, we’re covering one important angle to this by checking out some of the most prominent Google Forms alternatives.

Specifically, we’ll be diving deep into:

- [What is Google Forms?](#what-is-google-forms)
  - [Who uses Google Forms](#who-uses-google-forms)
- [Why would we look for a Google Forms alternative?](#why-would-we-look-for-a-google-forms-alternative)
- [6 Google Forms alternatives for 2026](#6-google-forms-alternatives-for-2026)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is Google Forms?

Part of the wider Google Workspace ecosystem, Google Forms is a free, web-based tool that allows users to create forms, quizzes, surveys, and other data collection tools without requiring any coding skills.

So, we can define form schemas with a range of built-in question types, as well as adding elements of design customization, including adding styling and logic, or creating multi-step forms.

Additionally, Google Forms offers a range of options for managing and analyzing form responses. For instance, we can track responses in real time, as well as using them to populate a Google Sheets document for more advanced analysis.

On top of this, we can take advantage of a range of add-ons and close integration with Apps Script in order to extend Google Forms’ capabilities.

The goal is to empower just about anyone to build effective forms and utilize the data that they collect using them.

As we’d expect from a Workspace product, Google Forms also places heavy emphasis on security. For instance, it offers encryption in transit and at rest, as well as a range of other security and compliance controls.

### Who uses Google Forms?

A huge variety of different types of users rely on Google Forms. 

Part of its ubiquity comes down to Google Forms’ suitability for personal or hobbyist projects. Since we can use the platform for free, with minimal feature restrictions, Google Forms is often the go-to choice for building simple, highly functional forms.

However, its use in business contexts shouldn’t be underestimated.

In particular, it’s a highly effective solution for non-technical colleagues to output working form solutions for themselves, without requiring extensive technical skills or having to engage IT to build these for them.

This is especially true, given its close integration with Google Sheets, which provides a familiar experience for most users to analyze and manage form responses, without specialist database skills or knowledge.

Of course, this doesn’t preclude Google Forms from being used by more technical colleagues too, especially those that need a quick and easy way to collect data in organizations that are already using Google Workspace more broadly.

Some of the most common use cases for Google Forms include surveys, quizzes, application forms, event registrations, request forms, and other data collection applications.

## Why would we look for a Google Forms alternative?

Despite Google Forms’ massive popularity, it would be unreasonable to expect it to be the most appropriate option for every team or use case.

So, we need to consider some of the reasons that we might want to opt for one of Google Forms’ competitors.

As we have already hinted at, one key reason for this is that Google Forms is largely intended to integrate with the wider Workspace ecosystem, especially Google Sheets. 

So, if we’re not using Workspace in our organization, or we don’t want to use Sheets to manage our response data, other solutions might be more suitable.

We can send Google Forms data to other storage solutions, such as SQL databases, but we’ll need to use third-party add-ons or intermediary tools like Zapier to achieve this. If this is a firm requirement, you might prefer a more streamlined experience.

Alternatively, some other platforms can offer us a larger degree of flexibility and control, including more in-depth styling and design customization or more advanced logic building capabilities.

Lastly, although Google Forms offers a high level of security, it’s a closed-source platform and can’t be self-hosted. So, if these are must-haves, we’ll want to look elsewhere.

## 6 Google Forms alternatives for 2026

With a clear understanding of what Google Forms is, what it offers, who uses it, and some its potential limitations, we can begin to consider some of the other platforms that are out there.

As we noted earlier, there’s a large amount of variety in the form builder space, with individual vendors targeting distinct segments.

We’ve chosen our six Google Forms alternatives to reflect this variety. These are:

1. [Budibase](#1-budibase)
2. [JotForm](#2-jotform)
3. [TypeForm](#3-typeform)
4. [Wufoo Forms](#4-wufoo-forms)
5. [Tally](#5-tally)
6. [Formbricks](#6-formbricks)

Let’s check each one out in turn.

### 1. Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action. With comprehensive data support, autogenerated UIs, powerful automations, and more, it’s the ideal tool for outputting secure forms with minimal custom code. 

![Budibase](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Budibase_Form_Builder_ki7pb1.webp "Budibase")

#### Features

Budibase offers connectivity for a range of RDBMSs, NoSQL tools, APIs, and Google Sheets, alongside our built-in low-code database. Budibase acts as a proxy to query external data securely, without ever storing it.

Once we’ve configured our data layer, we can autogenerate working forms and CRUD UIs based on our table schemas. Use the Budibase builder to add as much customization as you need, with optional JavaScript or CSS, conditional UIs, responsive design, and more.

Budibase also offers a powerful visual automation builder, complete with a range of triggers, actions, LLM operations, looping, and branching logic, making it ideal for more advanced form use cases.

{{< form-builder-cta >}}

#### Use cases

Our users choose Budibase to build all kinds of internal tools, including forms, approval apps, ticketing systems, admin panels, dashboards, CRUD apps, portals, and more.

Budibase is also fully optimized for security-conscious teams, with optional self-hosting, free SSO, custom RBAC, and a whole host of other security tools.

It’s the ideal solution for IT teams to output advanced forms, giving users full control over their data, design, and automation logic.

Take a look at our [features overview](https://budibase.com/product/) to learn more.

#### Pricing

With Budibase, you can build as many apps as you want for free if you self-host.

Paid plans start from $5 per month for end users and $50 for creators. This introduces reusable code snippets, custom branding, synchronous automations, Budibase AI, and other premium features.

Custom enterprise pricing is also available, with air-gapped deployments, enforceable SSO, creator access control, and a host of other advanced security tools.

Check out our [pricing page](https://budibase.com/pricing/) to learn more.

### 2. JotForm

Next, we have JotForm. As one of the best-known SaaS form builders, this is undoubtedly one of the most important Google Forms alternatives to be aware of.

![JotForm Google Forms Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/JotForm_rztftd.webp "JotForm Google Forms Alternatives")

(JotForm Website)

#### Pros

JotForm is a hugely popular platform, offering an impressive combination of powerful functionality and ease of use. It offers an intuitive drag-and-drop editor, as well as a huge library of templates to get up and running with form use cases quickly.

It’s also one of the more comprehensive platforms in this space, offering functionality for building data tables, apps, AI agents, fillable documents, and other solutions besides just forms.

As a form builder, JotForm is particularly feature-rich, offering a range of integration options, effective design customization tools, support for handling payment details, a workflow automation builder, and more.

#### Cons

Like Google Forms, one limitation of JotForm is that we can’t easily send data to SQL databases directly. Instead, we’ll need to leverage an intermediary tool like Zapier or Make to achieve this.

Some users also report that building more advanced forms in JotForm can be somewhat confusing or that other platforms offer more in-depth styling options.

Compared to Google Forms, many users might also find that JotForm’s more extensive functionality is excessive for their needs, and that they may prefer a more lightweight solution.

#### Pricing

JotForm offers relatively scalable pricing, with fixed tiers based on the number of forms and monthly submissions we need. There’s a free tier, enabling us to build up to five forms, with 100 monthly submissions.

Paid plans start from $34 for 25 forms and 1,000 monthly submissions. The most expensive fixed tier bills at $99 per month for 100 forms and 10,000 submissions.

We’ll need an enterprise license to overcome these limits, or to access functionality including multi-user licenses, payment submissions, SSO, API usage, and more.

### 3. TypeForm

TypeForm is another well-known form builder tool, with a strong reputation for enabling teams to output highly attractive data collection UIs, without extensive technical skills or expertise.

![TypeForm](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736004/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/TypeForm_vwjhdd.webp "TypeForm") (TypeForm Website)

#### Pros

One of TypeForm’s biggest selling points is the quality of the UIs we can create. In particular, it’s a highly effective tool for creating attractive multi-step forms with a sleek drag-and-drop interface.

TypeForm is also an impressive offering in terms of AI-based usability enhancements. In particular, it offers functionality for creating forms from natural language inputs, as well as LLM-powered question suggestions and response analysis.

Additionally, TypeForm offers a high level of enterprise readiness, including a wide range of integrations for common business platforms, as well as a variety of security controls and certifications.

#### Cons

One potential downside of TypeForm is that it’s a relatively opinionated form builder from a design point of view. So, while the forms we can build are highly attractive, they have a strong style, which might not be suitable for all applications.

For instance, it’s generally intended for multi-step surveys and forms, with one screen per question.

Like most other form builders, TypeForm also has limited support for sending data to SQL databases, instead requiring us to use an intermediary tool, such as Zapier.

#### Pricing

TypeForm offers several license tiers, based on the number of internal users and monthly responses we require. Paid plans start from $25 per month for a single user and 100 responses. Fixed tiers range up to $83 for five users and 10,000 responses.

Custom enterprise pricing is also available to overcome these limits, as well as access functionality, including SSO or custom domains and branding.

Novelly, TypeForm also offers vertical-specific pricing for marketing or HR teams, each with its own features and usage limits.

Take a look at our round-up of the top [TypeForm alternatives](https://budibase.com/blog/alternatives/typeform/) to learn more.

### 4. Wufoo Forms

Next, we have Wufoo Forms. This is a slightly different proposition to some of the Google Forms alternatives we’ve seen so far, offering a highly effective, yet comparatively streamlined standalone form builder.

![Wufoo Forms JotForm Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Wufoo_Forms_rffxeu.webp "Wufoo Forms JotForm Alternatives") (Wufoo Website)

#### Pros

One of Wufoo’s big advantages is its ease of use. Compared to some other platforms, it offers a relatively minimalist UI, based around a drag-and-drop interface that allows us to configure a range of different field types, as well as adding workflow logic to our forms.

Wufoo also offers a dedicated Theme Designer, where we can create custom styles to apply to our forms. Alternatively, it offers a range of pre-built themes that we can use straight out of the box.

As well as this, Wufoo provides functionality for building custom reports based on our form responses, making it a good fit for teams that need a streamlined experience for making sense of their data.

#### Cons

However, there are a few clear downsides to Wufoo Forms too. For one thing, many users note that its builder UI has a somewhat dated look and feel.

Despite its ease-of-use, Wufoo might not be the best choice for creating professional looking UIs. There’s a good level of customization in the Theme Designer, but other tools may let us output better looking forms without as much effort in terms of styling.

It’s also not quite as feature-rich as some of the other Google Forms alternatives we’ve seen, being better understood as a standalone form builder, compared to the more extensive capabilities of platforms like JotForm.

#### Pricing

Wufoo offers relatively generous pricing. Paid plans start at $16.25 offering a single user, ten forms, and 1,000 monthly combined responses.

Other plans start from $33.25 for unlimited forms, with up to five users and 10,000 monthly submissions. 

These range up to $210.25 for 60 users and 200,000 responses. Notably, besiders the Starter plan, Wufoo’s paid tiers largely have feature parity and only really vary in terms of usage limits. So, this could be a great choice for smaller-scale use cases with more advanced requirements.

### 5. Tally

Tally is a somewhat novel option in the market for Google Forms alternatives, offering a document editor-like UI for outputting custom data collection tools.

![Tally Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Tally_xzaatj.webp "Tally Forms")(Tally Website)

#### Pros

Perhaps Tally’s greatest strength is its text-based interface for creating forms. Whereas most tools use a visual builder, we can use Tally to simply type questions, in much the same way we would with a Word document or CMS platform.

This enables us to add a wide range of input blocks, including basic question types, as well as more advanced fields such as payment details, file uploads, and more.

Within this streamlined experience, Tally also packs in extensive functionality, including answer piping, conditional logic, hidden fields, support for partial submissions, and more.

#### Cons

At the same time, it’s worth noting that Tally’s text-based approach won’t be for everyone. To some extent, this comes down to personal preference, although some users note that creating and managing logic might be more intuitive with a full visual editor.

Reporting and analytics capabilities might also be more comprehensive in some other platforms.

Tally is also generally a stand-alone form builder, whereas other Google Forms alternatives enable us to build a wider variety of solutions, including apps and broader data management tools.

#### Pricing

Another attractive point about Tally is that it’s free to use with unlimited forms and submissions.

Some premium features, such as custom CSS, domains, and branding, email notifications, or fuller analytics capabilities, require a paid license, starting from $24 per month.

Business licenses bill at $74 per month, allowing us to control data retention, verify email addresses, or manage forms’ version histories.

### 6. Formbricks

Lastly, we have Formbricks. Rather than a standalone form builder, this is an open-source survey and experience management platform.

![FormBricks](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Formbricks_t2kpbg.webp "FormBricks")(Formbricks Website)

#### Pros

Formbricks is a very strong choice for survey use cases. It offers extensive styling, logic, and customization options in an intuitive visual platform. It also offers more niche functionality for these use cases, including support for creating in-app surveys.

On top of this, it’s a highly adept platform for more advanced form use cases, including complex logic, calculation fields, a variety of close-on rules, hidden fields, and more, as well as CX-specific functionality such as advanced segmentation options.

Notably, Formbricks is one of the only open-source and self-hostable platforms we’ve seen so far, making it a great choice for highly privacy-focused teams and use cases.

#### Cons

However, Formbricks might not be a suitable choice for all use cases. It’s generally optimized for experience management and survey building, so we might want to consider other options for a more generic form builder.

For instance, some of its more advanced capabilities could be extraneous for more straightforward data collection use cases.

According to some users, certain aspects of the platform might also benefit from a slightly higher technical skill level than in some other solutions, especially if we want to create our own integrations.

#### Pricing

Formbricks offers distinct pricing plans for its cloud-based and self-hosted platforms. There are free versions of each of these, with usage limits based on monthly contacts, responses, and projects in the cloud.

Paid licenses for the cloud product start $49 per month, for 5,000 responses and 7,500 contacts. This also gets us custom branding and attribute-based targeting.

Custom enterprise licenses are also available for both the cloud and self-hosted platforms.

## Turn data into action with Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action.

With extensive data connectivity, autogenerated UIs, powerful workflow automations, custom RBAC, free SSO, optional self-hosting, and more, there’s never been a better way to create advanced forms.
