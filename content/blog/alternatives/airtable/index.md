When Airtable launched in 2012, it was a real innovation. Spreadsheets hadn’t changed much in several decades. So, the power to add interfaces, automations, advanced in-line components, and external data syncing on top of this was huge.

Today, Airtable has upwards of 300,000 users - including some of the world’s biggest companies.

But, despite Airtable’s popularity, it’s not necessarily the ideal solution for every use case. Today, we’re exploring some of the other tools that teams can use to collaborate on data and manage internal processes, with our roundup of Airtable alternatives.

Specifically, we’re going to cover:
- What is Airtable?
- Who Uses Airtable?
- Why would you need an Airtable alternative?
- Top 6 Airtable Alternatives,
- Airtable vs Budibase,
- How to choose an Airtable alternative.

Let’s jump right in.

## What is Airtable?
Airtable is a visual data management platform that seeks to unify the way that businesses handle information within processes. So, rather than relying on a series of unconnected tools - Airtable aims to provide a single, coherent experience for teams to interact with data.

The core of this is a customizable spreadsheet-style interface where users can collaborate on data in a controlled manner. 

One way to think about this is that Airtable effectively sits somewhere between a spreadsheet tool and a full-on database. Besides this, there is functionality for building applications on top of your data, as well as unifying information, automating processes, and governing access.

Ultimately, the value-add here is that teams can achieve more advanced, tailored solutions - without the need for a more complex custom build.

### Who uses Airtable?
Airtable is largely used by colleagues in non-technical departments to create solutions, without necessarily having much in the way of development skills. For instance, within marketing, product, operations, finance, or sales teams.

Some of the biggest use cases include managing tasks, documents, contacts, projects, requests, customer interactions, or other day-to-day business data.

For example, Airtable is popular for handling simple tasks like data entry, CRUD operations, reporting, and request/approval flows. On-the-ground colleagues can output working solutions for these kinds of tasks, without relying on internal development resources.

## Why would you need an Airtable alternative?
But, there are clear downsides, too - many of which will limit Airtable’s viability, particularly for more advanced use cases.

One huge aspect of this is Airtable’s limited support for external databases. After all, its core pitch is aimed at teams with disparate data in spreadsheets and SaaS tools who need to achieve some of the functionality of a traditional RDBMS.

But this is not quite the reality for most larger businesses that store their critical data in traditional databases, in line with standard practices.

Connecting Airtable to MySQL or Postgres via APIs or third-party integrations is possible but does not use a native connector. 

So, it’s a convoluted experience fraught with potential pitfalls - and, therefore, might not be ideal for widespread usage or handling critical production data.

Other reasons for seeking out an Airtable alternative are more in line with traditional procurement decisions. For example, something as simple as finding a vendor that offers key enterprise features like SSO or audit logging at a more affordable price point.

Or, perhaps Airtable can’t match your non-functional requirements, even though the core functionality would add value. For instance, ruling it out because it’s closed-source and can’t be self-hosted.

## Top 6 Airtable alternatives
Before we jump into looking at specific alternatives to Airtable, it’s worth noting that there are a few distinct classes of tools that could be leveraged to meet the same core pain points. 

So, we have direct competitors, of course, but other options include low-code platforms, database tools, and even more traditional spreadsheet solutions. Each of these offers a slightly different slant on improving experiences around collaborative data management.

Our top picks are:
- Budibase
- SmartSheet
- Google Sheets
- NocoDB
- Appsheet
- Zoho Creator
