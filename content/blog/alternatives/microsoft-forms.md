Part of the wider Microsoft 365 ecosystem, Microsoft Forms is one of the most ubiquitous and widely used tools for creating UIs to collect data.

The goal is to provide non-technical users with a streamlined experience for building forms, polls, quizzes, and other data collection tools.

However, there are a huge number of form builder tools on the market, with individual vendors targeting distinct segments in terms of their ideal users and use cases. Naturally, this can make it highly tricky to determine which solution fits our needs the best.

Today, we’re examining one important angle on this, by checking out the most prominent Microsoft Forms alternatives that are available to us.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What is Microsoft Forms?](#what-is-microsoft-forms)
  - [Who uses Microsoft Forms?](#who-uses-microsoft-forms)
- [Why would we look for a Microsoft Forms alternative?](#why-would-we-look-for-a-microsoft-forms-alternative)
- [6 Microsoft Forms alternatives for 2025](#6-microsoft-forms-alternatives-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is Microsoft Forms?

![Microsoft Forms Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1757422550/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Microsoft_Forms_ln1cfi.webp "Microsoft Forms Alternatives")(Microsoft Forms Website)

As the name suggests, Microsoft Forms is Microsoft’s platform for building forms and other data collection UIs - especially surveys, polls, and quizzes.

This enables us to output solutions for collecting data, without requiring us to build these from scratch with custom code.

This centers around a highly streamlined builder where we can define questions with a range of different field types, as well as applying various pre-built or customized layouts and styles.

On top of this, Microsoft Forms offers us a range of options for managing and using collected data. There are capabilities for visualizing data with real-time charts and automated reports, as well as exports to Excel for more in-depth analysis.

As you might expect, one of the biggest selling points here is Microsoft Forms’ close integration with the wider Microsoft ecosystem. So, in addition to other 365 tools such as Excel, we can integrate our Forms with the Power Automate workflow automation platform.

Microsoft Forms also offers impressive AI functionality. Specifically, there are AI-based recommendations for questions and multiple-choice options, providing a highly streamlined experience for building data collection UIs.

### Who uses Microsoft Forms?

Knowing what Microsoft Forms is and what it can help us to achieve, it’s worth thinking about who the core users are.

This can include a diverse range of users in both personal and business contexts. In part, this is because Microsoft Forms requires minimal technical skills to output professional-looking form UIs - even compared to other no-code offerings.

This includes enabling users to add logic to build more complex forms, for instance, utilizing branching.

As such, Microsoft Forms is a popular option with a range of internal roles, including non-technical colleagues across business-level departments, including sales, marketing, customer success, HR, product, and more.

However, IT teams and other technical colleagues can also benefit from an expedited experience for creating forms.

Naturally, it’s also particularly popular with teams who are already embedded in the Microsoft ecosystem. First, because it’s included as part of the 365 platform, and secondly, because of its close integration with related tools.

## Why would we look for a Microsoft Forms alternative?

Before we start looking at some of the most prominent Microsoft Forms competitors, it’s worth outlining some of the platform’s potential limitations or other reasons that we might determine another tool is better suited to our needs.

Of course, it’s not realistic to think that any specific platform could be the right fit for every team or use case.

We can consider this from a couple of different angles. Firstly, there’s functionality. 

It’s important to be realistic that Microsoft Forms is intended to be a highly streamlined form builder. So, it might lack some of the customization or other advanced features that are available in other platforms.

For example, providing greater levels of design customization or enabling us to self-host.

Additionally, while Microsoft Forms offers us some capabilities for implementing logic, if we want to create more complex automation rules, we may need to rely on the Power Automate platform. By contrast, other form builders have more extensive built-in automation capabilities.

Lastly, while Microsoft Forms is included within the Microsoft 365 platform, we can’t purchase it as a standalone product.

As such, it’s often a great choice for teams that already heavily utilize Microsoft software internally, but might not make the most sense for teams that do not.

## 6 Microsoft Forms alternatives for 2025

With a good understanding of what Microsoft Forms is, how it’s used, and some of the factors that might lead us to seeking out other tools, we can begin to think about its key competitors.

To reflect the diversity of the form builder market, we’ve chosen a range of Microsoft Forms alternatives from different segments of this space.

Our picks are:

1. [Budibase](#1-budibase)
2. [Google Forms](#2-google-forms)
3. [JotForm](#3-jotform)
4. [TypeForm](#4-typeform)
5. [Wufoo](#5-wufoo)
6. [Tally Forms](#6-tally-forms)

Let’s check each one out in turn.

### 1. Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action. With extensive external data support, autogenerated UIs, and powerful automations, it’s the perfect choice for building advanced forms with optional custom code.

![Budibase](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Budibase_Form_Builder_ki7pb1.webp "Budibase")

#### Features

Budibase offers dedicated connectors for all kinds of RDBMSs, NoSQL tools, APIs, and more, alongside our built-in low-code database. Our platform provides complete flexibility to configure the exact data layer you need for all kinds of forms.

Once you’ve connected your data, Budibase offers autogenerated forms and CRUD UIs. We can use these as-is or add extensive customization in our drag-and-drop app builder, including conditional UIs or optional JavaScript and CSS.

Budibase is also the ideal solution for building forms that power business workflows. We offer a powerful visual automation builder, complete with a range of triggers, actions, and LLM operations, as well as looping and branching logic.

#### Use cases

Budibase is fully optimized for IT teams that need to build advanced forms on top of any data. With extensive integrations, custom RBAC, optional JavaScript, and more, it’s the perfect solution for building approval apps, ticketing systems, admin panels, and other internal tools.

Our users choose Budibase for full control over how and where their form data is stored. We offer optional self-hosting, free SSO, air-gapped deployments, and a range of other features for security-first teams.

Budibase also offers a range of AI capabilities, powered by OpenAI, Azure, or Budibase AI, including database schema and JavaScript generation, along with a whole host of pre-built LLM operations in the data and automation sections.

Take a look at our [product overview](https://budibase.com/product/) to learn more.

#### Pricing

With Budibase, you can build as many apps as you need for free, for up to five users in the cloud, or twenty if you self-host.

Paid plans start from $5 per month for end users and $50 for creators, as well as introducing custom branding, reusable code snippets, synchronous automations, Budibase AI, and more.

Custom enterprise licenses are also available, with air-gapped deployments, audit logs, PWA support, enforceable SSO, creator RBAC, and more.

Check out our [pricing page](https://budibase.com/pricing/) to learn more.

### 2. Google Forms

Next up, we have Google Forms. As well as being one of the best-known form builders, this is also one of the most directly comparable Microsoft Forms alternatives available today.

![Google Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Google_Workspace_gedssx.webp "Google Forms")(Google Forms Website)

#### Pros

Like Microsoft Forms, a huge part of Google Forms’ popularity is related to how quickly and easily we can create professional forms, with minimal technical expertise. Indeed, it’s a highly intuitive tool that will be usable by just about anyone.

As we’d expect from a Google product, it’s a particularly good fit for teams with stricter security requirements, including offering data encryption in transit and at rest, as well as other security measures across the wider Workspace ecosystem.

Google Forms is also strong in terms of managing and reporting on submission data. It offers real-time visualizations, as well as close integration with Google Sheets for performing more in-depth analysis.

#### Cons

However, despite its popularity, Google Forms also brings along its own challenges and limitations. Like Microsoft Forms, it’s largely optimized for outputting forms quickly and easily, whereas other platforms may offer more extensive customization option or advanced features.

For instance, it’s a relatively opinionated platform from a design point of view. While there’s good customization on offer, Google Forms still have quite a particular look and feel about them.

Additionally, Google Forms is closely integrated with the wider Google Workspace ecosystem, so this may be less applicable for teams whose wider operations aren’t embedded in this.

#### Pricing

Another reason for Google Forms’ massive popularity is that it's free to use within the Workspace platform.

On the flip side, this means that we can’t purchase it separately, so we’ll need a Workspace license if we want to use this on a paid plan.

As such, it could be a great fit for existing Google users, but other teams might not benefit as extensively.

### 3. JotForm

JotForm is a hugely popular platform, as well as being perhaps the best-known SaaS form builder. As such, it’s also one of the most important Microsoft Forms competitors to be aware of.

![JotForm Microsoft Forms Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/JotForm_rztftd.webp "JotForm Microsoft Forms Alternatives")

(JotForm Website)

#### Pros

JotForm offers extensive flexibility and scope for customization in an intuitive, modern form builder platform. This centers around a highly effective drag-and-drop editor, along with a vast library of pre-built, customizable form templates.

It’s also a particularly feature-rich form builder, with a range of integration options, extensive design customization, and a built-in workflow automation editor.

Additionally, JotForm offers functionality for building a wider variety of solutions besides forms, including apps, data tables, AI agents, ecommerce stores, fillable documents, e-signatures, and more. This opens it up to a wide range of use cases.

#### Cons

However, it’s also important to be aware of some of JotForm’s potential downsides. One of these is that, as with most other dedicated form builders, we can’t easily build forms on top of SQL databases, unless we use an intermediary tool such as Zapier.

On top of this, some users note that, with more in-depth styling options available, JotForm can present a slightly steeper learning curve than some other, more straightforward form builders.

Similarly, some users might find that JotForm’s feature set is excessive for their needs as a direct Microsoft Forms alternative.

#### Pricing

JotForm offers several license tiers, making it a potentially scalable option for a range of teams. Individual tiers are priced based on the number of forms and monthly submission volumes. We can build up to five forms for free, with a limit of 100 monthly submissions.

Paid plans start from $34 per month for 25 forms and 1,000 monthly submissions. These scale up to the most expensive fixed tier, which bills at $99 per month for 100 forms and 10,000 monthly submissions.

To go beyond these limits, or to access features including multi-user licenses, SSO, or API usage, we’ll need a custom enterprise license.

Take a look at our guide to the top [JotForm alternatives](https://budibase.com/blog/alternatives/jotform/).

### 4. TypeForm

Next up, we have TypeForm. This is another well-known, widely used form builder platform, with a particular focus on surveys and other customer-facing data collection workflows.

![TypeForm](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736004/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/TypeForm_vwjhdd.webp "TypeForm") (TypeForm Website)

#### Pros

TypeForm makes it incredibly easy to build professional, attractive multi-step forms. This centers around a modern visual interface, where we can define questions, apply themes, and configure logic.

On top of this, TypeForm offers impressive AI enhancements across the builder. Importantly, we can generate forms from natural language inputs. AI can also recommend questions or analyze responses, making it a powerful solution for less technical users.

TypeForm also offers a range of integrations, security standards, multi-language forms, and more, making it a great option for more advanced use cases or enterprise usage.

#### Cons

However, TypeForm also has some important downsides. While the forms we can create look great, they have a very specific look and feel to them. This is generally suitable for customer-facing workflows, but might be slightly off for internal use cases.

In terms of design customization, TypeForm is somewhat more limited than some other tools, focusing primarily on applying styling via themes. We can create our own form themes, but this is a paid feature.

Like many other Microsoft Forms alternatives, TypeForm is also slightly restrictive in terms of our forms’ underlying data models. Again, we can’t easily connect to SQL or other databases without relying on Zapier or another integration platform.

#### Pricing

TypeForm offers a range of pricing tiers, based on internal users and monthly form submissions. There’s a free tier, but this is limited to a single user and 10 responses.

Paid plans for the core product start from $25 per month for a single user and 100 responses. These range up to $83 for five users and 10,000 responses. 

We’ll need an enterprise license to overcome these limits or to access SSO or custom branding. Interesting, TypeForm also has dedicated pricing for Growth and People teams, with distinct feature sets.

### 5. Wufoo

Wufoo is a popular no-code form builder and cloud database. It’s a popular choice for building application forms, surveys, contact forms, and other data collection tools.

![Wufoo Forms JotForm Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Wufoo_Forms_rffxeu.webp "Wufoo Forms JotForm Alternatives") (Wufoo Website)

#### Pros

Wufoo is a great choice for teams that need an effective, easy-to-use platform for outputting custom forms. We can add and configure a range of field types, as well as conditional logic, page breaks, and other elements.

Wufoo enables us to utilize a range of built-in themes or create our own using the Theme Designer. This offers a no-code experience for applying styling and other visual customizations to our forms.

On top of this, Wufoo also offers capabilities for more advanced use cases, including support for payment details and file uploads, a workflow automation builder, and a range of tools for analyzing and reporting on form submissions.

#### Cons

One common complaint about Wufoo is that it’s a somewhat dated feeling platform. While it’s perfectly functional, this can nonetheless impact user experiences.

Similarly, it could require more effort in Wufoo to achieve our desired form UIs compared to some other platforms. Theme Designer gives us a lot of scope for styling, but other Microsoft Forms alternatives may look better out of the box.

As with other form builder tools, we’ll need to use Zapier or another intermediary tool if we want to send form data to SQL.

#### Pricing

Wufoo can be a comparatively affordable platform. Paid plans start from $16.25 for five forms and 1,000 responses, with a single user.

Other plans offer unlimited forms, but impose limits on internal users and monthly combined submissions. Licenses start at $33.25 for five users and 10,000 monthly responses. 

These range up to $210.25 per month, with 200,000 entries and 60 uses.

### 6. Tally Forms

Lastly, we have Tally Forms. This takes a somewhat novel approach to form building, based around a text editor interface, rather than a more traditional visual builder.

![Tally Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Tally_xzaatj.webp "Tally Forms")(Tally Website)

#### Pros

Tally Forms really stands out in terms of how easily we can output working forms. Its core interface is more like editing a Word document or page in a CMS, meaning we really need minimal technical abilities.

However, this doesn’t mean that Tally isn’t a feature-rich platform. We can configure and use a range of input types, including basic form fields, as well as more advanced elements, such as payment details, preference rankings, and file uploads.

Tally also offers a range of capabilities for more advanced use cases, with support for answer piping, conditional logic, partial submissions, pre-population, and more.

#### Cons

Tally’s text-based approach won’t be for everyone. So, although we can build effective logic into our forms, some users will naturally find it easier to do this with a visual editor, especially when it comes to managing or adjusting logic.

Some users also note that analytics and reporting capabilities may not be as advanced as some other Microsoft Forms alternatives.

Compared to some of the other platforms we’ve seen, Tally is one of the tools that could be best described as a stand-alone form builder. So, to build more advanced use cases or other types of solutions, we might want to look elsewhere.

#### Pricing

Another attractive aspect of Tally is that it’s free to use with unlimited forms and submissions. The free tier also offers extensive functionality, including features that we might need an enterprise license for within many other Microsoft Forms alternatives.

Some other features, including custom branding and domains or multi-user collaboration, require a Pro license, billing at $24 per month.

Business licenses give us the ability to control data retention, verify emails, or manage forms’ version histories for $74 per month.
