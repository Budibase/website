The core of this is ServiceDesk Plus, an ITIL-aligned service management solution with extensive coverage for ITSM workflows, including incident management, asset management, ticketing, problem management, change management, configuration management, and more.

This provides IT teams with a unified experience for managing end-user interactions as well as other aspects of our service portfolio, such as capacity management and resource planning.

ManageEngine is also a popular solution for streamlining tasks under the umbrella of IT management. For instance, utilizing self-service portals or automated workflows for handling common request types.

More recently, it’s introduced a range of AI-driven features to power IT workflows, including virtual agents and predictive analytics.

On the whole, it's an attractive offering for a range of organizations, with different levels of maturity in their IT department.

So…

Let’s check them out in detail.

### 1. Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action. Our customers choose Budibase to power a huge range of IT workflows, including managing requests, inventories, ticketing, and more.

{{< vimeo id="1054494533" title="Ticketing System Template" >}}

#### Features

Budibase is the ideal solution for building [internal tools](https://budibase.com/internal-tools/) on top of any data. We offer dedicated connectors to query all kinds of RDBMSs, NoSQL tools, API, spreadsheets, and more, alongside our built-in database.

Budibase acts as a proxy, querying external data without storying. We then offer spreadsheet-like interactions, custom RBAC, and autogenerated UIs on top of connected sources. 

We also offer a range of capabilities aimed at IT teams that need to streamline workflows. We offer a visual automation builder with complex looping and branching logic, as well as both custom LLM configs and built-in AI functionality.

#### Use cases

Our users choose Budibase to build a huge range of mission-critical IT workflows, including handling ticketing, service request management, incident reporting, admin functions, asset inventories, and much more.

We offer a visual RBAC editor and custom database views, which are perfect for workflows where different types of users need granular permissions for specific data actions. 

Budibase is also the smart choice for IT workflows with heightened security needs. We offer optional self-hosting, air-gapped deployments, free SSO, and much more - putting data in the hands of the exact users who need it.

{{< template-cta template = "ticketingSystem" >}}

#### Pricing

Budibase offers scalable pricing for teams of all sizes. You can build as many free apps as you like for up to five users in the cloud or twenty if you self-host. Unlike some other ManageEngine automations, we don’t place restrictions on connected data for free users.

Paid plans start from $5 per end-user per month and $50 for app creators. This also introduces reusable code snippets, custom app branding, app back-ups, and Budibase AI.

We offer creator-only pricing for enterprise customers, meaning you only need to pay for the colleagues who build applications in Budibase. Enterprise licenses also offer air-gapped deployments, enforceable SSO, and other advanced security tools.

### 2. ServiceNow

ServiceNow is probably the most ubiquitous name in the IT management software space. It offers a highly configurable platform for enterprise teams to manage the full scope of their IT processes.

You might also like our guide to the top [ServiceNow alternatives](https://budibase.com/blog/alternatives/servicenow/).

![ManageEngine Alternatives ServiceNow](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1739460072/cms/alternatives/freshservice-vs-servicenow/ServiceNow_Home_Page_vdipqj.webp "ManageEngine Alternatives ServiceNow")

#### Pros

One of ServiceNow’s biggest strengths is the breadth of capabilities on offer. This centers around a comprehensive set of ITIL-aligned service management tools, including configuration management, change control, asset management, service desk management, and more.

ServiceNow is also one of the most comprehensive solutions for configuration options, including a range of low-code and hard-code-focused tools for building interfaces, workflows, automated processes, and more.

It also provides impressive AI capabilities. For instance, tools for creating virtual agents, integration for a range of NLPs, and highly advanced predictive analytics for monitoring IT service metrics.

#### Cons

However, configurability can often be a double-edged sword. Compared to some other platforms, ServiceNow can require more up-front resources to roll out, with some reports citing a higher time-to-value than other platforms in this space.

Some teams also report a higher skills barrier for modifying and maintaining workflows, although, to some extent, this is related to its more advanced capabilities.

As such, while it’s a hugely powerful platform for large organizations or complex IT processes, teams with smaller scale or more sporadic use cases might find a different option more suitable.

#### Pricing

ServiceNow’s pricing isn’t publicly available. Instead, licenses are offered on a custom basis. These are based on user volumes, as well as the specific functionality we require.

For example, specific aspects of the platform such as ITSM, ITOM, field service management, or BPA can be billed separately. This means that contracts can be tailored to the needs of individual organizations that only need specific subset functionality.

However, we may also need to take account of indirect costs. For instance, many teams use a third-party contractor or reseller to purchase ServiceNow, the cost of which would also need to be factored in.

### 3. Jira Service Management

Next up, we have Jira Service Management. Part of the wide Atlassian ecosystem, this is a flexible, highly collaborative platform for teams that want to streamline IT service management workflows.

Take a look at our guide to the top [Jira Service Management](https://budibase.com/blog/alternatives/jira-service-management/) alternatives.

![Jira Service Management](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1739973623/cms/alternatives/open-source-jira-alternatives/Jira_Website_bbz95y.webp "Jira Service Management")

#### Pros

One of the clear upsides of JSM is its close integration with the rest of the Jira platform, as well as related tools like Confluence and BitBucket. This makes it a great option for teams whose IT service are highly grounded in software development or DevOps processes.

As a broader service desk, JSM offers a highly modern, efficient user experience. This includes conversational ticketing, which provides a single point of contact for end users and service agents, including information from SLAs and various communications channels.

It also offers a range of more advanced capabilities for creating custom automation rules, along with a huge library of customizable UI templates.

#### Cons

One potential drawback of JSM as a ManageEngine alternative is that it’s generally less ITIL-focused than some other platforms, with many of the core ITIL practices being restricted to more expensive license tiers.

Similarly, on-prem usage requires a Jira Data Center license, which will potentially be out of reach of teams that require a self-hosted instance of a smaller-scale solution.

It’s also worth noting that JSM’s close integration with the wider Atlassian suite will be of less use to teams that aren’t already using these tools - although it does still offer a huge range of third-party integration options.

#### Pricing

Jira Service Management can be used for free for up to three agents, with core service desk functionality. Beyond this, paid licenses bill on a monthly per agent basis, with discounts for larger user volumes.

There are some important feature restrictions across the various pricing tiers. For instance, we’ll need a Premium license for change management, incident management, problem management, or virtual agents.

Enterprise licenses are available with more advanced security features. We’ll also need a Jira Data Center plan to self-host JSM.

### 4. OTRS

OTRS stands for Open Ticket Request System. As the name suggests, this is a platform for handling ticketing and service request management.

![OTRS](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1741618552/cms/alternatives/OTRS_pmucca.webp "OTRS")

#### Pros

OTRS is a great option for teams that need a full-featured IT service desk solution. Out of the box, it offers tools for the full spectrum of ITIL processes, making it a strong choice for IT teams in large organizations.

It also offers an impressive range of customization and configuration options, including customizable UIs, a visual workflow builder, and extensive options to connect to external databases.

Notably, OTRS also offers a range of time and resource management tools for service delivery teams, including project boards, shared calendars, and more.

#### Cons

One potential downside of OTRS compared to some ManageEngine alternatives is a slightly more dated feeling UI, especially when it comes to admin settings or building automations.

It’s also somewhat more lacking in AI capabilities, especially compared to large enterprise competitors such as ServiceNow.

Some users also complain of performance issues when utilizing OTRS at a large scale, including high user volumes or large numbers of simultaneous requests. Additionally, the open-source community edition has reached its EoL and is no longer maintained.

#### Pricing

Pricing for OTRS is somewhat opaque. It offers both managed and self-hosted solutions, depending on your specific needs.

There are four license tiers based on your support needs and user volumes. However, pricing for these is not provided.

Instead, you’ll need to contact sales to get a quote for specific configuration options.

### 5. Zammad

Zammad is an open-source helpdesk and ticketing solution that can be leveraged for a range of ITSM processes. It’s also a strong pick for security-focused use cases.

![Zammad](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1740755846/cms/alternatives/incident-management-tools/Zammad_Screenshot_iz1dnt.webp "Zammad")

#### Pros

One of Zammad’s big selling points is its UI. It offers a clean, modern, and intuitive experience for end users and service agents. It also offers strong functionality for collaborative working, including comments and mentions.

It’s also a strong option for its security credentials. For instance, it offers free SSO, along with LDAP support for user and rights management.

Zammad offers extensive customization options, including custom ticketing data objects, triggerable macros, and a powerful API for integrating with external platforms.

#### Cons

While Zammad is a great option for ticketing and help desk management, it lacks the more extensive scope of ITSM capabilities that some other ManageEngine alternatives can offer. This might mean relying on additional platforms for certain tasks.

For instance, there’s no dedicated solution for asset management or change management.

It also lacks some important features for handling advanced workflows, including a low-code editor for building custom UIs or more complex automation rules.

#### Pricing

Zammad offers both cloud-based and self-hosted options. If we opt for their managed cloud solution, there are three license tiers, ranging from €5-24 per agent per month. However, there are maximum agent seats across each of these.

However, even the fully featured Plus package is relatively cheap, making this one of the more affordable options we’ve seen.

For self-hosted instances, support packages start from €2,999 billed annually, with increasing costs depending on the level of support we need.

### 6. GLPI

Lastly, we have GLPI. This is another open-source option, this time covering the wider spectrum of ITSM processes.

![GLPI](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1716391725/cms/open-source-help-desk-software/GLPI_wpwyqq.webp "GLPI")

#### Pros

GLPI offers impressive coverage for a wide range of service management processes, including managing helpdesks, ticketing, service financial, assets inventories, configuration data, and projects.

Its CMDB capabilities are particularly impressive and highly suited to complex IT environments, including everything from data center infrastructure to peripherals and consumables, like printer cartridges.

GLPI is also a strong offering in terms of visualizing and interacting with data, including a range of reporting tools as well as interfaces for handling project data, tasks, Kanban boards, and more.

#### Cons

Some users complain that configuring GLPI for their exact needs can present a relatively high learning curve. For instance, some UI modifications will require us alter PHP files and understand the underlying data structures.

At a more basic level, some reports also state that certain admin options can be hard to find and change. This may introduce additional time and effort to roll out a solution.

There are also reports of performance issues when handling large volumes of data or transactions.

#### Pricing

GLPI offers both cloud and on-prem options. There’s an open-source version of the platform, which is offered under the GNU license.

Paid self-hosted licenses are offered with different levels of support, agent seats, and restrictions on the number of assets we can process. More expensive tiers also introduce additional plug-in options.

The cloud platform bills from €19 per agent per month, including community plug-ins.
