(*Moveworks Website*)

As part of this, it offers a range of tools for deploying AI-powered solutions across search, task automation, low-code agent building, and more.

This is a great option for teams that want to deploy agentic systems spanning entire teams, giving end users a single, autonomous solution for resolving their requests.

Moveworks is a highly capable platform, offering advanced functionality, including deep integrations for hundreds of tools, pre-built agent templates, advanced security and compliance features, and support for an extensive LLM ecosystem.

Like Glean, Moveworks ships with highly effective enterprise search and RAG tools, complete with extensive connectivity for data sources and enforceable permissions and access controls, helping to ensure information is accessible to the right colleagues across the enterprise.

### Target usage

With an understanding of what each platform offers at a high level, we can move on to thinking more deeply about how and where they’re used. This draws on a couple of related questions, including their ideal use cases and the kinds of teams and even individual roles they target.

Naturally, these can form important decision points when selecting a platform, by informing several key factors such as user experiences, technical requirements, and optimization for handling specific types of tasks.

Here’s what we need to know.

#### Glean

Glean is largely a no-code platform. So, compared to some other platforms in this space, it offers a relatively low technical skills barrier. For instance, we can build Glean agents without writing a single line of code, alongside a huge library of native connectors for SaaS platforms.

This works alongside strict security guardrails, such as authenticated search and permissions enforcement across connected tools. 

As such, Glean has the potential to be an attractive option in a huge range of organizations, by enabling enterprise-grade solutions, without necessarily requiring extensive IT resources to implement. 

This positions it as a tool that could be helpful for a range of personas, from IT teams that want to save time to users in other departments that need to implement solutions without extensive development skills. 

However, some knowledge of core concepts like APIs and data structures will still be helpful.

In terms of use cases, Glean covers relatively diverse ground, including engineering, customer services, sales, people, and IT, alongside a wide range of integration options for tools under these verticals.

This includes enterprise search and agentic AI solutions for handling workflows within these departments, as well as personalized assistants to help on-the-ground colleagues carry out tasks.

#### Moveworks

Moveworks provides more of a low-code experience for creating AI agents. Like Glean, this centers around a visual interface for configuring agent behavior with minimal custom code, opening it up to a huge range of user personas and organization sizes.

It also provides additional power and flexibility for developers, based on an innovative plug-in architecture, which enables developers to create additional capabilities on top of what Moveworks offers out of the box.

So, to some extent, it’s likely that developers will be able to get more out of the platform than other colleagues. At the same time, Moveworks offers a rich library of pre-built agent templates, meaning the required development resources will still typically be fairly low.

Like Glean, Moveworks offers a high level of enterprise-readiness, including a wide range of security controls, as well as more developer friendly tools like an API mocker and a manifest generator for configuring how plug-ins should be used.

As we noted earlier, Moveworks’ ideal use cases are largely centered around internal service processes and workflows. 

In particular, it’s a very strong offering for building agentic systems for ITSM use cases, including a wide range of ready-to-use IT service tools, as well as deep integration options with platforms such as ServiceNow.

Like Glean, it’s also a powerful option for other internal verticals, such as HR, finance, engineering, and sales.

### Pricing

Of course, one of the biggest factors when considering our options for any type of software is pricing. For [AI agentic workflows](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/ai-agentic-workflows/), this is a particular concern. 

As an emerging, fast-moving space, many teams are struggling to achieve ROI with their AI agent initiatives. There are a few key reasons behind this.

Firstly, as teams experiment with multiple platforms across different use cases, many IT teams are beginning to encounter `agent sprawl`. Second, due to the wide-reaching impact of agentic AI across enterprises, the true costs and benefits of implementation can be difficult to establish. 

However, most platforms in this space don’t offer fixed, public pricing tiers.

This is the case for both Glean and Moveworks.

That is, both platforms are licensed on a custom basis, requiring us to contact their respective sales teams for a quote.

Like quotes from other software vendors, these may draw on factors such as our user volumes, hosting requirements, the scope of our use case, support and services, or other variables.

So, it would be important to use real-world quotes based on your specific needs in order to make an informed decision about which is likely to be the more cost-effective option.

## Usage, capabilities, and technical considerations

Now that we have a good grasp of what each platform is, how it’s used, and who it’s suited for, we can begin to compare and contrast them in more detail.

It’s important to note that, although they offer broadly similar capabilities at a high level, each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and optimization focus. 

Of course, they’re both also wide-reaching platforms. So, to help work our way through this comparison, we’ve broken it down into a few key functional areas. That way, we can examine what each individual platform offers in each area.

### Enterprise search

First up, we have enterprise search capabilities. Enterprise search refers to the practice of providing a singular interface through which users or tools can locate and retrieve information across the entirety of the organization.

![Enterprise Search](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1744896875/cms/ai-agents/ai-agentic-workflows/AI_Agentic_Workflows_Featured_1_yblhxa.webp "Enterprise Search")

This includes a range of sources, such as databases, file stores, internal systems, documents, directories, and more.

Modern enterprise solutions leverage AI to enhance experiences here. This involves both using NLP and machine learning to better match users’ requests, as well as summarizing information from a diverse range of sources to provide accurate, comprehensible answers to queries.

Let’s see how this works in Glean vs Moveworks.

#### Glean

Enterprise search is one area where Glean is particularly effective. This starts with extensive connectivity for data and information sources. There are over 100 connectors for external tools, as well as APIs to connect to additional enterprise applications.

Once connected to information sources, Glean offers a high degree of domain specificity in LLM-powered retrieval and summarization. The goal is to ensure coherence, empowering end users with the information they actually need.

This works by continuously training Glean’s models on your company’s language and terminology. Glean also utilizes company knowledge graphs to help ensure the most relevant information is returned to individual users.

Connected data sources are indexed in real time, with Glean automatically enforcing the existing access control or permissions that apply to these. 

Glean then generates responses based on the returned information, in response to user queries, including follow-ups.

#### Moveworks

Moveworks is also a highly impressive offering for enterprise search. Like Glean, it offers 100+ connectors, alongside its marketplace of app plugins and tools to build our own integrations.

This positions it as a highly integration-focused platform, capable of searching information from a huge range of sources.

Moveworks offers support for an extensive ecosystem of LLMs, giving us a huge amount of flexibility to select the model that’s most appropriate for our needs.

Like the rest of the platform, enterprise search is powered by an agentic reasoning engine. This acts to understand employees' intent and goals, develop intelligent plans to meet these, and return the most relevant information to meet user requirements.

This also enables us to develop agentic RAG solutions, combining enterprise search with autonomous actions, eliminating the need for employees to switch tools in order to act on the information that’s returned by their queries.

Moveworks also offers a high level of visibility into how enterprise search is being used, including a notifications panel for critical updates and requests, as well as analytics tools for monitoring adoption, popular topics, and content quality.

### Agentic AI

Perhaps the most important point of comparison for Glean vs Moveworks is how each platform can empower us to build, deploy, and manage AI agents. 

Over the past couple of years, interest in agentic AI has exploded, with teams across all organizations and company sizes rushing to implement solutions. 

However, the market for AI agent builders is diverse, with vendors targeting a range of granular user personas and use cases. Let’s see where each platform sits in this market.

#### Glean

As we said earlier, Glean offers a [no-code AI agent builder](https://budibase.com/blog/ai-agents/no-code-ai-agent-builders/). We can start with either a natural language prompt describing our desired behavior or by using a quick-start template for our particular use case, powered by the built-in reasoning engine.

Whichever method we choose to create our agent, we can then edit and customize it with Glean’s intuitive drag-and-drop editor. This is a familiar, flow-chart-based experience, complete with looping and conditional logic for granular behavior.

We can pick specific models for each individual step in our agentic flow, meaning that Glean is a strong offering for teams that want to build highly advanced agentic behavior, without necessarily incurring extensive development resources.

As noted earlier, Glean is able to securely connect to a wide range of live data sources, systems, and third-party tools, empowering our agents to take action while maintaining the permissions and access rules related to the underlying platforms.

Glean also offers a range of tools for deploying, orchestrating, and scaling agents. We can deploy agents to a range of existing work platforms, like Teams, Slack or ServiceNow, as well as using event-based or conditional triggers.

There’s intelligent request routing, as well as coordination agents, enabling systems to handle even complex requests with minimal human intervention. We can even update routing logic, triggers, or agent behavior over time, without the need to fully rebuild systems. 

#### Moveworks

Like Glean, Moveworks offers a visual builder for configuring agent behavior. However, the platform as a whole is better described low-code, whereas Glean is a no-code platform. So, it’s accessible to a range of users, but development skills may be useful for more advanced use cases, involving custom scripting.

At the same time, Moveworks is highly optimized for a fast time-to-value. It provides a huge marketplace for pre-built, usable agents that span entire teams and business verticals. There are also packs of agent behavior plug-ins available for major enterprise platforms.

Agent behavior can be configured in the visual builder, AI Agent Studio. Again, this flow-chart-based, enabling users with all levels of development skills to output working agentic systems.

We can utilize a variety of models within agentic flows, offering us the flexibility to choose specific models that are best suited for individual actions and tasks.

As we know, Moveworks offers extensive integration options, including deep connectivity with a range of enterprise service management platforms. Like Glean, security is ensured as agents retain the roles and permissions associated with connected tools.

Moveworks also offers advanced analytics and insights to help maximize agent impact. We can assess logs and agent performance in order to identify optimization opportunities and troubleshoot issues.

### Integrations

As you might expect, integration options are an absolutely critical consideration when it comes to selecting an agentic AI or enterprise search platform. There are a few angles we can take when considering this.

First, and perhaps most obviously, there’s the number of integrations available. This goes a long way to determining the likelihood that a specific platform is going to be supported. 

However, we’ll also want to consider the depth of actions within each integration option, along with the level of configuration required to perform specific tasks. Then, of course, there are the experiences for connecting to additional systems, outside of native integrations.

#### Glean

Glean’s integration options are extensive. As we’ve hinted at already, these cover a wide range of tools and resources, via native, push API, and web history-based connectors. This provides a high degree of configurability while still ensuring that connections work out of the box.

Native integrations include a huge range of popular enterprise SaaS platforms, such as ServiceNow, Teams, BambooHR, and Google Workspace, alongside service management, development, and DevOps tools, like Confluence, GitHub, Azure, and more.

Push API and web history connectors open up an even greater array of tools that Glean can index information across.

The Glean Model Hub gives users access to a wide variety of the latest LLMs from major vendors, including OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex. We can easily adjust these, including setting their temperature, creativity level, and response format, without any coding skills.

We also have several options for connecting to additional systems and resources, besides what Glean offers out of the box connectors for.

There are APIs available to utilize Glean’s capabilities as an AI layer for other external applications. For instance, triggering agent actions from external tools or utilizing search capabilities to create fully custom RAG apps.

For more custom integration options, Glean offers several options, including a web SDK, a dedicated MCP server, and LangChain support, opening the door to a range of more advanced, customized use cases, assuming we have the required development skills.

#### Moveworks

Moveworks is also a very strong offering when it comes to connectivity. Like Glean, it boasts a large range of native integrations, especially for common enterprise and service management platforms, including Jira, ServiceNow, Teams, and more.

There are also plug-in packs available for over 100 software platforms, providing easy-to-install agentic actions within the Moveworks platform.

Moveworks also provides us with extensive flexibility to connect to additional tools using custom System or HTTP requests within the platform, enabling us to connect to just about any existing tool securely.

We can also build our own content connector APIs to ingest content from external platforms into Moveworks for enterprise search.

Like Glean, Moveworks provides its own API to enable us to further connect to external tools for more custom use cases.

The Manifest Generator is a helpful quality-of-life addition that helps create custom agent actions more easily.

As we said earlier, Moveworks offers support for a range of LLMs, including Microsoft, Meta, and other models, as well as Hugging Face and more.

### Hosting, deployment, and security

Lastly, agentic AI and enterprise search solutions will invariably need to interact with mission-critical systems, data, processes, and resources.

As such, it’s important that we have the ability to put appropriate controls in place to manage this.

However, at the same time, we don’t want to incur additional costs or other IT resources by choosing a platform that offers inflexible or difficult-to-maintain hosting and deployment.

Here’s what we need to know about Glean vs Moveworks.

#### Glean

Glean is offered with two distinct models. These are a hosted SaaS platform, or a self-hosted on-prem solution. This means that it offers flexibility for different kinds of organizations, depending on their requirements and available IT resources.

In both cases, Glean uses a single-tenant infrastructure and retains responsibility for infrastructure and application management, as well as support access to the customer environment.

Self-hosting allows us to have greater control over things like data residency, security protocols, logs, and more, along with enabling us to networking to other internal systems more easily.

Installation methods for the self-hosted product include Google Cloud Compute and AWS.

Glean also provides a range of security and compliance features, as well as SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance.

#### Moveworks

By contrast, Moveworks is primarily a cloud-based product, hosted on AWS infrastructure. We have options for data residency in different regions, but Moveworks themselves still manage the infrastructure which the platform is hosted on.

There is still a huge range of security measures in place to protect your data, including encryption at rest and in transit, strict access controls, data minimization and masking, and more.

Similarly, Moveworks offers compliance for several major security standards, including ISO27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and more.

For connecting to internal systems and ingesting data, Moveworks also offers a dedicated on-prem agent. This is a software tool that’s installed on local infrastructure, enabling you to interact with on-prem systems.
