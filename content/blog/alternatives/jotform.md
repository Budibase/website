JotForm is perhaps the best-known form builder tool on the market today. However, this is a more varied space than it might appear. 

On the one hand, most platforms offer wider capabilities beyond simply outputting form UIs. On the other hand, different vendors often have their own more granular target personas and use cases.

Today, we’re shedding light on this by exploring the market for JotForm alternatives, including a range of solutions that are aimed at different kinds of users and applications.

Specifically, we’ll be covering:

- [What is JotForm?](#what-is-jotform)
  - [Who uses JotForm?](#who-uses-jotform)
  - [Why would we look for a JotForm alternative?](#why-would-we-look-for-a-jotform-alternative)
- [How to choose a JotForm alternative](#how-to-choose-a-jotform-alternative)
- [8 JotForm alternatives for 2025](#8-jotform-alternatives-for-2025)

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is JotForm?

JotForm is a popular SaaS platform for building custom web forms, alongside basic apps, ecommerce stores, fillable documents, AI agents, workflows, and other solutions.

![JotForm Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/JotForm_rztftd.webp "JotForm Alternatives")

(JotForm Website)

This is centered around a set of no-code experiences, including drag-and-drop interfaces, customizable templates, and visual tools for automating workflows or adding logic to forms.

The goal is to enable users to output professional solutions quickly and with minimal technical skills.

JotForm also offers a wide range of integration options for a variety of business tools, making it a great choice for teams that need to create solutions for working with a range of different types of data.

On top of this, it offers tools for sharing data and collaborating on incoming form submissions, meaning that JotForm can be used for a range of different types of internal tools and customer-facing solutions.

### Who uses JotForm?

As we said a moment ago, JotForm is largely a no-code solution for building forms, apps, and other data management tools.

This makes it a great fit for a variety of different kinds of users. Naturally, one important cohort here is non-technical colleagues who need to create forms and other solutions. For instance, enabling business-line users to build forms, rather than requiring IT to do so.

IT teams can also benefit from using JotForm as a quick and easy way to output simple solutions rather than building them from scratch.

In terms of organizations, JotForm is used in a variety of industries. It’s popular with SMEs, offering highly scalable pricing. There’s also an Enterprise version of the platform for larger organizations.

### Why would we look for a JotForm alternative?

With a better grasp of what JotForm is and who uses it, it’s worth considering some of the factors that might lead us to decide a different form builder is better suited to our needs.

Some of the biggest factors here include flexibility, control, and customization.

That is, as a no-code offering, JotForm is optimized for speed and usability. However, this is always a bit of a balancing act. As such, for more advanced use cases, we might decide that we need a platform with more flexibility.

For instance, one that offers specific integration options, custom code, self-hosting, or other capabilities.

At the same time, JotForm is a relatively feature-rich platform, so some teams might decide that a more streamlined approach to form building suits their needs better.

The other big factor when choosing any type of software tool is pricing.

While JotForm is generally a very cost-effective option, we might still find that alternative solutions offer better value for money.

For example, key features such as SSO and access to the API are limited to the Enterprise tier in JotForm’s pricing, so if these are firm requirements, we may wish to opt for a different form builder.

We’ll return to some of these ideas in the following section as we examine our specific picks for JotForm alternatives.

## 8 JotForm alternatives for 2025

As we noted earlier, the market for form builders is highly diverse. To reflect this, we’ve chosen a range of platforms from different corners of this space, giving a broader overview of some of the most prominent JotForm competitors.

Specifically, our picks are:

1. [Budibase](#1-budibase)
2. [TypeForm](#2-typeform)
3. [Formstack](#3-formstack)
4. [SurveyMonkey](#4-surveymonkey)
5. [Wufoo Forms](#5-wufoo-forms)
6. [Google Forms](#6-google-forms)
7. [Formbricks](#7-formbricks)
8. [Tally](#8-tally)

Let’s check each one out in turn.

### 1. Budibase

Budibase is the open-source low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action. With extensive data connectivity, autogenerated UIs, powerful AI-driven automations, and more, there’s never been an easier way to ship professional, secure forms.

![Budibase](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736005/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Budibase_Form_Builder_ki7pb1.webp "Budibase")

#### Features

Budibase offers extensive support for a range of RDBMSs, NoSQL tools, APIs, spreadsheets, and more, alongside our built-in, low-code database. When you connect to external sources, Budibase acts as a proxy, querying your data without ever storing it.

Once we’ve connected our data, we can autogenerate fully customizable forms and CRUD UIs based on table schemas. The Budibase builder offers huge flexibility, including optional custom code, conditional UIs, mobile-friendly designs, theming, CSS styling, and more.

Budibase is also the ideal solution for automating data-centric workflows. Our automations editor offers an intuitive, flexible tool for creating complex business logic, with a range of configurable triggers, actions, and LLM-powered operations.

{{< cta >}}

#### Use cases

Budibase is fully optimized for busy IT teams in all industries. With optional self-hosting, free SSO, custom RBAC, and much more, it’s the perfect fit for building all kinds of internal tools in large, security-conscious organizations.

Our users choose Budibase for a wide range of solutions, including forms, approval apps, workflow management, ticketing tools, dashboards, admin panels, and much more.

Take a look at our [features overview](https://budibase.com/) to learn more.

#### Pricing

Budibase offers highly scalable pricing that is perfect for all kinds of teams. You can build as many apps as you want for free, for up to five users in the cloud or twenty if you self-host. We also offer free SSO across all license tiers.

Paid plans start from $5 per-user per-month and $50 for app creators, including custom branding, reusable code snippets, Budibase AI, PDF generation, synchronous automations, and more.

We also offer custom enterprise pricing, complete with air-gapped deployments, enforceable SSO, environment variables, and other key security tools. Check out our [pricing page](https://budibase.com/pricing/) to find the plan that’s right for you.

### 2. TypeForm

TypeForm is another one of the most prominent platforms in the form builder space. In particular, it’s a highly popular tool for building public-facing forms, including surveys, quizzes, polls, landing pages, and more.

![TypeForm](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736004/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/TypeForm_vwjhdd.webp "TypeForm") (TypeForm Website)

#### Pros

A huge part of TypeForm’s popularity comes down to how easily we can create attractive, professional data collection UIs. In particular, it offers a drag-and-drop experience that’s highly optimized for building sleek multi-step forms.

More recently, TypeForm has also launched a range of AI capabilities, aimed at helping users to output working forms from natural language inputs, as well as analyzing response data, and suggesting questions and content changes.

Like JotForm, TypeForm also offers a high degree of enterprise-readiness, including extensive integration options, along with a wide range of security features and certifications.

#### Cons

One downside of TypeForm is that there’s limited support for using form UIs to send data to external databases. For instance, we can connect to MySQL or other RDBMSs, but we’ll need to utilize tools like Zapier as middleware to set up these integrations.

TypeForm also lacks some of the flexibility we can see with some other form builders in terms of our data layer. For instance, we can’t edit the schema of our forms and their underlying data tables independently of one another, which may make some use cases more difficult.

Although TypeForm forms look amazing, they’re also highly opinionated from a design point of view. So, they may not necessarily fit the look and feel you need for all situations.

#### Pricing

TypeForm is priced using fixed tiers with limits on internal users and monthly responses. Paid plans start from $25 per month for a single user and 100 responses. Fixed tiers range up to $83 for five users and 10,000 responses.

To overcome these limits, as well as accessing features such as custom domains and branding or SSO, we’ll need a custom enterprise license.

Novelly, TypeForm also has dedicated license types for marketing or HR teams, each coming with use-case specific features, including fixed or custom tiers within each vertical.

### 3. Formstack

Part of the wider Intellistack ecosystem, Formstack is another no-code option for building forms within a range of business workflows, with a particular focus on providing a robust, efficient data collection process.

![FormStack](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736004/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/FormStack_veldmy.webp "FormStack") (FormStack Website)

#### Pros

Users rate Formstack highly for its versatility and configurability. For instance, we have extensive opportunities to add conditional logic or automate approval flows within our form solutions.

FormStack also offers capabilities around document generation and digital signatures, opening it up to a wide range of real-world administrative workflows.

On top of this, FormStack is well-regarded for its range of integrations with common business tools. In particular, it offers close integration with the Salesforce platform, making it a great choice for teams whose operations are heavily embedded in this.

#### Cons

However, Formstack also has some important downsides. For one thing, some users complain that Formstack is not as effective as some other platforms when it comes to designing form UIs.

According to some reports, some users may also find it somewhat less intuitive than other JotForm alternatives, or that it presents a comparatively steep learning curve.

As with many other form builders, we’ll need to utilize Zapier or another integration platform if we want to send form data directly to a SQL database.

#### Pricing

Compared to some of the other JotForm alternatives we have seen, Formstack is a relatively expensive platform. Plans start from $82 per month for a single builder, 25 forms, with 1,000 responses each.

We’ll need a Suite plan at $250 for three users and 100 forms to access important functionality, such as workflow automations.

Custom enterprise pricing is also available, as well as dedicated licenses for Salesforce use cases or managing document workflows.

### 4. SurveyMonkey

Next, we have SurveyMonkey. As the name suggests, this is a platform that’s highly tailored towards creating professional surveys, although it also offers capabilities for a range of other kinds of external-facing forms.

![SurveyMonkey](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/SurveyMonkey_w6z3dp.webp "SurveyMonkey") (SurveyMonkey Website)

#### Pros

SurveyMonkey offers a range of impressive capabilities for outputting effective surveys without custom code, including AI tools to help design UIs and define questions.

On top of this, it’s a particularly strong option for teams that need a JotForm alternative with advanced analytics functionality. For example, we can use AI-powered trend analysis to easily identify and extract insights from our survey data.

As a more general form builder, users also rate SurveyMonkey highly for flexibility and ease of use, offering a streamlined experience handling data collection and associated workflows.

#### Cons

Like some of the other form builder platforms we’ve seen so far, a clear limitation of Survey Monkey is that we can’t natively send form data directly to external databases, without using additional integration tools.

Some users also complain that feature restrictions across its pricing tiers are somewhat less generous than other JotForm alternatives, which has the potential to make SurveyMonkey relatively expensive for many use cases.

According to some reports, other platforms may offer more extensive design customization options compared to SurveyMonkey.

#### Pricing

Generally speaking, SurveyMonkey has the potential to be quite cost-effective, with team plans starting from $30 per user per month. Individual plans bill at $39 per user per month, with unlimited surveys and up to 15,000 responses per year.

However, in terms of feature restrictions across pricing tiers, SurveyMonkey has the potential to be quite expensive. For instance, on individual plans, we’ll need a Premier license, at $139 per month for custom branding or to export data to CSVs.

Additionally, key features such as SSO and data encryption are restricted to custom enterprise pricing, which may mean that SurveyMonkey isn’t a viable option for smaller-scale use cases where security is still a priority.

### 5. Wufoo Forms

Wufoo Forms is a standalone form builder platform from the team behind SurveyMonkey, offering a large amount of design customization and flexibility for creating custom forms.

![Wufoo Forms JotForm Alternatives](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Wufoo_Forms_rffxeu.webp "Wufoo Forms JotForm Alternatives") (Wufoo Website)

#### Pros

Wufoo is a popular form builder, owing in large part to its ease of use. It offers a fairly minimalist UI for the core form-building experience, with a drag-and-drop interface that allows us to add a variety of field types, along with using conditional logic, page breaks, and more.

We can then utilize Wufoo’s Theme Designer to define the styling for our forms. This provides a visual experience for enabling us to style various elements of our end-user interface, such as fonts and color schemes.

Wufoo also offers strong capabilities around analyzing data, including a drag-and-drop experience for creating dashboards and reports based on our form submissions.

#### Cons

One key downside to Wufoo Forms compared to some of the other JotForm alternatives we’ve seen so far is that its core builder UI has a comparatively dated feel.

On top of this, although Wuffo is incredibly easy to use, it could be relatively difficult to create professional-looking forms. That is, the Theme Designer offers a large amount of customization, but other tools might allow us to output more attractive forms without adding styling.

Like many other form builder tools, Wufoo forms does not offer direct support for SQL databases or other external sources without using Zapier or a similar platform. 

#### Pricing

Wufoo Forms has the potential to be relatively affordable. There’s a working free tier, which offers a single user, ten forms, and 1,000 combined responses. Notably though, we can’t password protect free forms.

On paid plans, we can create unlimited forms, with limits on internal users and total submissions across the tiers. These start from $33.25 per month for five users and 10,000 submissions.

More expensive tiers bill at $83.25 per month for 20 users and $210.25 for 60. Additionally, it’s worth pointing out that Wufoo’s paid plans have feature parity. So, they only vary in terms of usage limits.

### 6. Google Forms

Part of the wider Workspace platform, Google Forms is probably the best-known form builder solution on the market today.

![Google Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736003/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Google_Workspace_gedssx.webp "Google Forms")(Google Forms Website)

#### Pros

Undoubtedly, one of Google Forms’ primary selling points is its sleek, intuitive user experience. We can easily create professional-looking forms, using an interface that will be familiar and easy to navigate for almost anyone.

Forms is also a great choice for teams that need highly secure solutions for collecting data, including encryption in transit and at rest, as well as a range of other security measures across the wider Workspace ecosystem.

Importantly, Forms offers us several options for interacting with submissions, including real-time visualization, as well as close integration with Google Sheets and the wider Workspace platform for more advanced analysis.

#### Cons

One potential downside of Google Forms is that it is very opinionated from a design point of view. So, although we do have extensive options for customization, Google Forms still have an unmistakable look and feel about them.

Similarly, although we can add deeper customization with Apps Script or Forms’ library of add-ons, other form builders might be able to handle certain more advanced use cases better out of the box.

Additionally, since Google Forms is largely intended to integrate with the wider Workspace ecosystem, including Google Sheets, we might want to consider alternatives if we’re not currently using this extensively.

#### Pricing

One clear benefit of Google Forms is that it’s free to use. This is one of the reasons for its popularity, powering everything from personal projects to data collection tools for businesses.

However, an important downside to this is that it can’t be purchased separately. Instead, we’ll need a license for the wider Workspace ecosystem to access paid plans.

So, it could be a great fit if we’re already using Workspace across our wider business, but it may not be the best choice if we are not.

### 7. Formbricks

Next, we have Formbricks. This is an open-source survey builder and experience management platform, aimed at improving experiences for customers and internal employees.

![FormBricks](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Formbricks_t2kpbg.webp "FormBricks")(Formbricks Website)

#### Pros

As a survey builder, Formbricks is a very strong offering. It offers extensive styling, logic, and customization options in an intuitive, visual builder.

In particular, Formbricks is a great solution for building more advanced forms, with complex logic, calculation fields, hidden fields, various close-on rules, and a host of other tools. It also offers tools for creating in-app surveys for product teams.

It’s also one of the only open-source solutions we’ve seen so far, as well as being self-hostable. This could make ait a good fit for teams with heightened security requirements around their data collection efforts.

#### Cons

Some users might find that Formbricks is a little bit too technical for their needs or knowledge level. For instance, some reports state that some coding skills might be helpful for advanced tasks, like creating our own integrations.

As such, for a more streamlined, easy-to-implement JotForm alternative, we might want to look elsewhere.

Additionally, as Formbricks is optimized for survey and CX use cases, other tools might be better suited to more straightforward form building.

#### Pricing

Formbricks offers distinct pricing models for its cloud and self-hosted offerings. We can use either version for free, with limitations on monthly contacts, responses, and projects in the free cloud version.

Paid plans in the cloud start from $49 per month, for 5,000 responses and 7,500 contacts, along with other features such as custom branding and attribute-based targeting.

Enterprise plans are offered for both the cloud and self-hosted products on a custom basis.

### 8. Tally

Lastly, we have Tally. This is a somewhat unique offering, giving us unlimited forms and submissions in a document editor-like experience.

![Tally Forms](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1756736002/cms/alternatives/individual-form-builders/Tally_xzaatj.webp "Tally Forms")(Tally Website)

#### Pros

Tally’s big selling point is its novel, intuitive interface for building forms. This centers around a text-based interface, where we can simply type questions as we would in a Word document. This will be a familiar experience to many less technical colleagues.

Tally utilizes a range of pre-configured input blocks to enable us to build forms, including UI components for a variety of common data types, as well as more complex inputs such as payment details, visual rankings, file uploads, and more.

Despite its streamlined feel, Tally provides an impressive array of capabilities for more advanced use cases, including answer piping, conditional logic, partial submissions, calculation variables, hidden fields, and more.

#### Cons

However, there are a couple of downsides to Tally too. Some users note that, although we can build reasonably complex logic, the experiences for this are less visual than some other platforms. This can make logic more difficult to configure and manage.

According to some reports, analytics and reporting functionality are somewhat more limited than in some other platforms.

It’s also one of the platforms we’ve seen that could most strictly be described as a stand-alone form builder, whereas many other JotForm alternatives offer this within a wider bundle of capabilities.

#### Pricing

Importantly, Tally is free to use, with unlimited forms and submissions. Naturally, this could make it a very attractive option for many teams.

We’ll need a paid license, starting from $24 per month, for important features such as custom branding and domains, custom CSS, email notifications, and form visit analytics.

Business licenses are available at $74 per month, allowing us to control data retention, verify emails, and manage forms’ version histories.

## Turn data into action with Budibase

Budibase is the open-source, low-code platform that empowers IT teams to turn data into action.

With extensive external data support, autogenerated forms and CRUD UIs, AI-powered automations, free SSO, optional self-hosting, custom RBAC, and more, there’s never been a better way for internal teams to build advanced forms.

Take a look at our [features overview](https://budibase.com/product/) to learn more.
