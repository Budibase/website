An effective IT team is the heart of any successful organization. Asset maintenance and inventory management are key here. Ensuring that the right devices are available and working correctly is critical to all other business processes.

When done properly, asset management helps to ensure profitability, by reducing admin costs. When assets are managed poorly, businesses are exposed to risks, inefficiencies, and poor outcomes.

## What is IT asset management?

Asset management is all about making sure that your business gets the most value out of each of its devices. This means maximizing utility, while minimizing losses and risks, across your entire inventory.

For IT teams, there are many key challenges here:

* Accounting for all devices.
* Deploying assets to where they are needed.
* Maintaining and servicing your inventory.
* Managing costs.
* Patch management.
* Lifecycle management and retiring devices.

The goal is to ensure that your organization’s IT inventory is accessible, reliable, secure, and profitable.

### Why do you need asset management software?

Digital tools take the legwork out of IT asset management. Countless organizations still manage devices using spreadsheets, emails, or even pen and paper. This is far from ideal.

Tracking and managing assets with manual tools creates avoidable admin work, risk, and scope for human error.

The alternative is using dedicated IT asset management software. Digital tools allow you to automate processes, eliminate risks, and provide more streamlined workflows.

### What do asset management tools include?

All asset management tools contain two components:

1. A database for managing device information.
2. A front-end interface for calling, querying and manipulating device data.

For example, businesses might store and use data on how devices are used, their cumulative cost over time, their maintenance needs, and more. The goal is to draw maximum value from each device while minimizing ongoing operational costs.

Asset management systems empower you to use this information, without the need for advanced database skills. This saves time and money, by creating intuitive and streamlined workflows for IT teams.

### Instant deployment and rental

A key part of asset management is deploying the right devices to the right users. Our template offers instantaneous asset requests. With a searchable inventory screen and intuitive rental form, employees can quickly and easily request the devices they need.

Our template is built around three databases for _assets_, _requests_, and _services_. When a user completes a rental form, a new row is created on the _requests_ table. This is linked to the respective row of the _assets_ table, using simple relationships

Your IT team can then search, view, manage, and approve all requests. When a request is approved, the asset is then marked as unavailable, and updated with the current user’s information.

### Cost management

Our open-source IT asset management software offers advanced cost management. We’ve provided functionality to automatically calculate depreciation over time. Quickly view current asset values, either as a gross figure or percentage of the purchase price.

Simply set an annual depreciation rate for each asset, and our platform takes care of the rest.

Budibase offers a built-in JavaScript editor, for creating custom depreciation rules. Set additional variables, or alter the depreciation interval, to suit your specific needs.
