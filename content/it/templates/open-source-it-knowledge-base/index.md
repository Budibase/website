Modern businesses deal with huge amounts of complex information. IT teams require quick and efficient access to information on various systems, hardware, and software solutions.

Effective organization and streamlined UIs are critical. Whether debugging internal tools or responding to customer queries, speed is everything when it comes to accessing knowledge assets.

## What is a knowledge base?

A knowledge base is a dedicated platform for storing resources and documents. The goal is to give users a quick and easy way to find the information they need. This might include common queries, technical details, solutions to known problems, specifications, and more.

Of course, the contents of knowledge bases vary from organization to organization.

Technology is changing constantly. It’s crucial that your knowledge base tool can be quickly and easily updated, to match the current needs of your business.

### Why do you need a knowledge base tool?

Effective knowledge bases help to ensure profitability across your entire organization. When information is disorganized, IT teams encounter excessive admin time, and scope for human error.

Many businesses manage knowledge using spreadsheets or shared documents. Others simply rely on team members knowing which colleague for knowledge sharing. This leads to inefficient processes, poor outcomes, and unnecessary operations costs.

Efficient IT teams are crucial for successful modern businesses. An effective knowledge base ensures that businesses can remain competitive, through streamlined processes.

### What should an IT knowledge base contain?

Most knowledge bases are built around two parts:

* A database for storing information.
* A front-end interface for searching, accessing, viewing, and using this information.

Of course, specific database entries will vary from business to business. So will the length or format of entries. The key is ensuring that users can access, manipulate, and add information, with an intuitive user experience.

The best knowledge base tools fully streamline internal IT processes. This includes automated workflows, role-based access control, and integrations with existing service management tools.

Our open-source IT knowledge base is built for flexibility, customization, and fast deployment.

### Create and manage resources

Our template is designed for businesses that need to centralize, organize, and manage knowledge. We’ve built our knowledge base tool around intuitive and navigable screens for creating, sorting, searching, and viewing information resources.

We’ve provided simple [form interfaces](https://budibase.com/forms) for creating and searching knowledge entries. In just a few clicks, users can create new records, without the need for extensive technical skills.

### Streamlined customer support

Access to information is critical for positive customer support outcomes. Support agents simply can’t retain all relevant technical information in their heads. Service teams must have vast amounts of information at their fingertips.

Our template is built for maximum efficiency. We’ve provided interfaces to make it as easy as possible to find the right information, in seconds. Use any data field to search and filter your knowledge base.

Each knowledge base entry has a clearly presented detail page. Agents can quickly consume key information, and decide on support actions.

### Custom data fields

Our open-source knowledge base template is fully customizable. We’ve provided common data fields for IT knowledge management. With Budibase, you can even add attachment files directly to your database entries.

Our template is ideal for document management and resource sharing within IT teams.

Add, remove, or alter any of our data fields, to fully meet your knowledge management needs. With Budibase, it’s easy to edit database columns. Our platform will also auto-populate forms, tables, and filtering options to match new data fields.

### Categorizing, sharing, and storing documents

Budibase makes it easy to create categories and taxonomies within your knowledge base. Our listings pages are fully searchable by both category and client. Use our simple drop-down boxes to sort and filter knowledge base entries.

Like all effective content management systems, our template is perfect for securely sharing and storing documents.

Centralize all of your documentation, product specifications, playbooks, and more, with a simple file upload interface.

### Custom access permissions

Like all Budibase tools, our template offers fully customizable role-based access control. Grant access to different users, based on their job role, seniority, or other variables. Our platform empowers businesses to control exactly who accesses their app data.

Our template is built around two permission tiers. _Basic_ users can search, access, and view any information resource. _Power_ users can add new entries, or edit existing records in the knowledge base.

We’ve also provided two additional permission tiers, which can be used to quickly create more complex access control structures.
