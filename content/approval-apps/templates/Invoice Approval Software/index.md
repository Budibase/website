In large organizations, managing vendors, suppliers, and payments is a huge challenge. The key issue here is organizing and administering payments. When handling large volumes of payments, it’s easy for things to go wrong.

Our template is designed to streamline invoice approval workflows, reduce admin costs, and create better vendor relationships.

## What is invoice approval software?

Invoice approval software allows your employees to submit invoices. These can then be viewed, managed, and paid by your finance team, within one tool. In other words, this is a closed platform for submitting, managing, and processing supplier payments and purchase orders according to defined business rules.

This replaces manual invoice submission and management. For example, without a dedicated tool, users generally have to send invoices to their managers. This leads to poor oversight, miscommunications, and disorganization.

In extreme cases, invoices might go unpaid, leading to poor vendor relationships.

Our free invoice approval software offers a user-friendly alternative to manually processing submissions.

### Why do businesses use digital approval tools?

Dedicated approval workflow tools are a much smarter way to manage invoices. Digitizing your approval workflows is a simple and effective way to reduce admin costs and streamline internal processes, while also maximizing process adherence.

Invoice approval workflow software also leads to improved supplier experiences.

Rather than manually sending invoices to your account owners, employeess can simply upload new invoices directly to a centralized platform. They can then view, edit, and query the status of each invoice, without the need for excessive calls and emails.

### What should invoice approval software include?

A basic invoice approval app has three components:

1. A [form interface](https://budibase.com/forms) for users to submit invoices.
2. Functionality for users to manage and respond to new invoices.
3. A back-end database for storing and managing invoice information, including a history of status changes.

The best tools allow you to automate your invoice approval workflows. 

## Our invoice approval software template

Our invoice approval software template is built for efficiency and fast deployment.

Our free invoice software offers:

* Support for external databases.
* Complete customization.
* Automated processes.
* Intuitive UI.
* Tiered permissions.
* Third-party integrations.
* Responsive design.
* Optional self-hosting.
* Design customization.
* Streamlined workflows.

With our template, you can build deployable custom approval software in minutes. Our intuitive, low-code builder allows you to automate invoice approval workflows quickly and easily.

### Instant invoice submission

Our template is built around a fast and intuitive interface for submitting invoices. In seconds, users can upload invoices to your workflow software, without the hassle of manually contacting your finance team.

Users can upload a wide range of attachments. Other fields are automatically populated using default values.

When a user completes the submission form, a new row is created in the _invoices_ database. Employees can then view or edit key details of their own invoices, while their managers can view submissions from all users.

### Custom invoive approval workflows

Of course, every business has different approval workflows. Customize your invoice approval software to fully match your internal processes. We’ve provided a _status_ data field for entries in our _invoices_ database.

When a new invoice is submitted, it’s assigned the _submitted_ status. Internal users can then change this to _approved, declined,_ or _queried_, and provide comments for submitters. Each time an invoice's status changes, a new row is created in the *History* table, providing a clear track record of how each one progresses through our workflow.

With Budibase, you can easily set up rules for automatic approval. For example, you might want to create auto-approve conditions, based on trusted suppliers, or for invoices under a value threshold.

### Access control

When it comes to invoice processing, data protection is crucial. Our template makes it easy to control how different users access your invoice approval software. We've based our workflow around two custom roles. _Employee_ users can submit invoices, and view their own previous submissions.

_Manager_ users can view and respond to any submitted invoice.

With Budibase, you have the power to fully customize your permission tiers. All Budibase apps come with four levels of access. You also have the complete flexibility to add and remove tiers as you see fit.

### Access from mobile devices

Like all Budibase tools, our invoice approval template is fully mobile responsive and accessibility tested. Design elements automatically scale and resize to fit perfectly on the users’ screens.

Business apps are only as good as the way users interact with them. Mobile responsiveness is crucial for adoption by internal and external users.

Give your team an invoicing tool that they can use anywhere, from any device.
