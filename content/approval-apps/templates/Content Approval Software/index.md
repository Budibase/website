Content approval can be a lengthy process. Like any creative process, there is massive scope for delay, miscommunication, and missed deadlines. This applies equally to agency and in-house creative teams.

The answer to this is digitization. Modern software tools make it easy to create streamlined and cost-effective approval workflows. From ideation to delivery, our template lets you deliver high-quality content, at a fraction of the cost.

## What is content approval software?

Content approval tools are closed systems, which allow users to request, submit, review, and approve content. Depending on your business, this might be used to manage internal workflows or client projects.

The goal is to automate your submission, review, and approval process, as far as possible.

Effective content approval tools also provide integrated file sharing and communications features. Clients and internal teams can manage all elements of the delivery process, from a single platform.

### Why do businesses use content approval software?

Creative projects have some of the lengthiest and most costly workflows. A large part of this is communications surrounding creative briefs, goals, and assets. This is exacerbated when different stakeholders have different creative ideas.

Content approval software is used to simplify these processes, reducing project costs.

This ensures that internal and agency content teams can maintain profitability.

### What do content approval apps contain?

Content approval tools should replicate your existing editorial workflows. This means providing specific stages for:

1. Ideation & content requests.
2. Content submission.
3. Review and comments.
4. Approval.

In other words, approval tools allow users to request, submit, receive, review, and approve content. This could be blog articles, videos, podcasts, design work, or any other kind of content materials.

### Streamline approval workflows

Our content approval software template streamlines editorial processes. We’ve provided a four-stage approval process. Each project is automatically assigned a status of _pending, submitted, approved,_ or _declined_, based on user actions.

Manage content projects from initial requests to delivery, without the need for lengthy calls and meetings.

With Budibase, you can completely customize your content approval workflows. Add steps, conditionality, or automated approval processes, based on your existing processes.

### Secure file sharing

Many content teams rely on third-party tools to share files. Often, this means using basic, insecure tools, such as email attachments, or Google Docs. This creates security risks, as well as disorganization.

Our content approval software template offers a simple and secure way to share project files. Give clients and colleagues a convenient way to store, access, and manage content files.

We’ve provided attachment fields for different stages of the content delivery process. Upload assets, project files, and more, in a wide variety of file formats. That way, you can implement your own security standards for all stored files.

### Real-time project oversight

Our template provides a convenient way to manage projects, from start to finish. Say goodbye to time-consuming project updates. With our content approval workflow software, users can simply log in to view the latest updates to their project status.

Our template is built for both agency and internal use. Clients and internal teams can access separate content pipeline screens. External users can view any content projects for their own account, while internal teams can view all content projects.

Within each individual project page, users can take different actions, based on the current status. This creates a fully intuitive and simple UI, maximizing efficiency and minimizing admin costs.

### Improved communications

Effective content approval software streamlines communications. With our template, all project communications are contained within a single platform. We’ve provided several long-form text boxes for adding comments, notes, and queries.

Simplify communications, by gathering the same information for each new content project. Save time for clients and creatives alike, by focusing only on the required information.

Add your SMTP credentials or use the _mailto_ command to quickly contact colleagues and clients from within the platform.

### Process automation

Our template supports a wide variety of process automations. Trigger Budibase’s library of built-in automations with any in-app action. We’ve also provided a JavaScript editor, to add advanced, custom functionality to our template.

Use third-party app integrations to trigger automations in existing tools from within your approval tool.

With Budibase, you can automatically query and edit content project data. Create rules and conditions to trigger automations for communications, billing, assigning tasks, and project management.

### Intuitive UX

We’ve built our content approval template for maximum usability. Our intuitive form interfaces allow users to create and respond to content requests in seconds. Replace lengthy briefing calls with near-instant content requests.

To simplify navigation, we’ve provided separate screens for internal and external users, providing a fully streamlined UI.

Our template is also fully mobile responsive and tested for key accessibility standards.

### Tiered permissions

Our template gives you complete control over how different users access your content approval system. We’ve built our approval workflow software around two permission tiers. _Basic_ users can access, submit, and manage content requests for their own accounts.

_Power_ users can manage, edit, and respond to content for all users.

With Budibase, you have complete scope to customize your apps’ access control. Add or remove permission tiers, or assign different levels of access to users, however you like.

### Dynamic filtering

We’ve provided dynamic filtering on each of our project listing screens. With Budibase, locating project information is quick and simple. Easily search and filter different content projects, based on their client, status, category, or due date.

Users can filter using simple _equals_ and _contains_ expressions for any data field. For more complex filtering, they can also add mathematical or boolean filters for supported data types.

You have complete control over the filtering options you provide for users. For example, you might choose to limit filtering for clients, to provide a simpler UI.
