In many businesses, approval workflows for new projects are complex, with numerous stakeholders involved. Digital approval tools improve oversight and efficiency when kicking off new projects.

Our approval workflow software template provides a simple and effective way to manage project requests in line with established business processes. Streamline communications, request workflows, and project management with our intuitive approval app.

## What is approval management software?

Approval management software creates a robust, digital process for handling new project requests. Employees can submit project initiation requests. Depending on your internal business rules, different stakeholders can then review these and handle approvals.

In other words, project approval systems take your existing workflows and simplify them in an intuitive digital platform.

The key to an effective approval management system is replicating your existing review and approval processes. This ensures that team members can make informed approval or rejection decisions during project planning.

### Why do businesses use approval systems?

All projects require approval of some kind. However, different kinds of projects need sign-off from different stakeholders. This can create confusion, as employees don’t necessarily know who to approach with approval requests.

Project approval systems are an effective way to cut internal admin costs. Digital approval workflow management eliminates the need for most project request calls and meetings. This frees your team up to deal with more pressing work.

Digital approval workflows also cut the scope for miscommunications as we manage approvals. By gathering only the information you need to make an approval decision, you can greatly improve project management processes.

### What should a project approval system contain?

Project approval tools essentially contain two elements:

1. A form for submitting new project requests,
2. A system for reviewing, and approving new requests.

The key thing is that projects are assessed according to defined business rules. For instance, the relevant department's remaining budget.

## Our project approval template

### Advanced approval workflows

We’ve also created a separate *History* table that tracks change to the status of project requests as they progress through our approval flow.
