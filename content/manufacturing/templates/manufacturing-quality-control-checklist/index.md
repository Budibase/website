As a business, your reputation is based on the quality of your products. Even minor defects will undermine your revenue. Customers base their purchasing decisions on your reputation, as well as their own experience of your products.

Even a single defect could potentially cost you several customers. Effective quality control is critical. Ensuring that each of your products is manufactured to the highest possible standards helps to guarantee long-term success.

## What is a quality control checklist?

Businesses of all kinds use checklists to ensure that processes are closely and accurately followed. In quality control, this means using repeatable and detailed checklists to maximize compliance with assurance standards.

For manufacturing businesses, the key is ensuring that your products meet the highest standards. This includes quality, functionality, appearance, packaging, and more.

It doesn’t matter if you make high-end electronics or everyday consumer goods. Every successful manufacturing business is built on a track record of consistent quality, across all of its products.

### Why digitize quality control checks?

Quality assurance is incredibly labor-intensive. This includes the time required to carry out quality inspections, as well as administrative work that facilitates this. For even the simplest of products, this can quickly become a large share of your costs.

Additionally, quality assurance processes are only as effective as their results. Oversight of your quality control outcomes is critical.

Management teams must have access to analytics and data on trends in quality assurance workflows. This includes both resourcing and outcomes. Of course, a key element of this is identifying individual products with high failure rates.

### What should a quality control checklist tool contain?

Digital checklist tools have two key components.

These are:

1. A data layer for storing information on products and quality control tasks.
2. A front-end interface for submitting checklists and analyzing data.

For a quality control checklist, the data layer includes information on the specific inspection requirements for each product. It also stores details of each completed checklist.

The front-end allows users to submit checklists, view and edit products, and access all data. This means giving your users an intuitive interface for calling and manipulating your app’s back-end data.

The most effective checklist apps provide additional functionality for creating more efficient workflows. For example, by automating key admin processes, and integrating with existing solutions.

## Our manufacturing quality control checklist template

Our quality control checklist for manufacturing is the fast and cost-effective way to digitize your assurance workflows.

We’ve built our template for:

* External data support.
* Complete customization.
* Automation.
* Intuitive UI.
* Custom RBAC.
* Integrations.
* Responsive design.
* Flexible hosting.
* Auto-generated screens.
* Streamlined workflows.

In minutes, you can have a fully customized and deployable digital checklist tool for quality control.

### Simplify quality control processes

Our template is built for streamlined quality checklist workflows. Give your team a simple and intuitive tool to register product inspections, in seconds. We’ve designed our quality control checklist to minimize both quality management and admin workloads.

We’ve built our template around two linked databases for _products_ and _inspections_. This provides a simple and effective way to store and share the inspection requirements for each individual item.

When a new checklist is completed, the details are stored in the _inspections_ database. This is also attached to the relevant _products_ entry, using simple relationship variables.

### Intuitive checklist interfaces

Our template maximizes clarity and accuracy around quality control checklists. Users are guided through the requirements of each inspection item, with a simple pass/fail interface at each stage.

Quality control agents can leave comments on each item in any inspection checklist. We’ve created a multi-step form interface for our checklists, for optimum usability.

Simply provide the inspection requirements for each of your products. Our template then guides users through the process of completing each quality control checklist.

### Manage products and work submissions

Our checklist app is built for total oversight over quality control tasks. We’ve provided dedicated screens to search, filter, view, manage, and edit both product and inspection entries.

Use our _dynamic filter_ components to sort and isolate entries, by any database variable. Quickly find the exact right products and inspection reports, with minimal effort. Use any combination of filtering expressions to sort data.

We’ve created our inspection reports to automatically fail any product which doesn’t meet the requirements on any checklist item. When a product passes all checklist items, it’s automatically categorized as an overall pass.

### Role-based access control

Our template is built around fully customizable RBAC. Assign different permissions to users, based on their role, seniority, location, or any other variable. With Budibase, you have complete control over how users access your app data.

Straight out of the box, _basic_ users can search and view all products, and complete checklists. _Power_ users can edit any entry, view inspection reports, and add new products.

We’ve also provided two additional permission tiers, offering total scope for customization.
