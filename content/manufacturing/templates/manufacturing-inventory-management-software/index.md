Managing inventories is a massive challenge for manufacturing businesses. Inventory management is the process of maintaining, tracking, and analyzing inventories of raw materials, finished goods, and works-in-progress.

Each of these different types of inventory influences your requirements for the others. Managing this requires a high degree of customization, automation, and adherence to existing business rules.

## What is inventory management software?

As the name suggests, inventory management systems are used to digitize your stock flows and order management. Specifically, this means managing stock volumes, locations, movement, orders, processing, and value.

Since manufacturing businesses handle different categories of stock, this often leads to complex workflows. This problem is amplified by modern, globalized supply chains.

Inventory management software provides a single platform to control stock movement across your entire organization. Centralize everything from purchasing raw materials to distributing finished goods to satisfy customer demand.

### Why build inventory management software?

For even the smallest manufacturer, an effective inventory platform is critical. Without digital inventory management, it’s almost impossible to achieve profitability.

Building a custom manufacturing inventory system allows you to perfectly tailor your tools to your existing business processes. This is crucial for the manufacturing industry, where stock management and inventory control workflows are unique to different businesses.

The way your raw materials inventory influences your production processes will differ greatly from your competitors.

As such, off-the-shelf manufacturing software solutions are less likely to be effective.

Building a custom solution is the most effective way to achieve an inventory management tool that drives ROI.

### What should inventory management for the manufacturing industry include?

Inventory management tools essentially contain two elements:

1. A data layer, where information on products, materials, and other items is stored.
2. A front-end interface, for calling, querying, manipulating, and editing data.

For the manufacturing industry, the data layer will consist of linked databases for raw materials, finished products, and any other item class.

The front-end interface should allow you to alter stock and analyze data on item value and quantity. This is crucial for multi-location warehouse management.

Of course, the best inventory management platforms contain additional features for automating workflows and reducing operational costs.
