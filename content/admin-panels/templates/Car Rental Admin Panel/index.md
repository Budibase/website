Managing a profitable fleet requires concrete data. Between maintenance, admin, and logistics, rental companies have incredibly high operating costs. It’s crucial for decision teams to have thorough oversight.

Beyond this, gathering and visualizing data greatly improves decision-making. Admin panels allow car rental companies to identify and track trends in vehicle usage, costs, and servicing. In turn, this boosts profitability.

## What is an admin panel?

Admin panels are simple platforms where users can access, view, and manage specific data. Of course, the specific contents vary from industry to industry. The key is giving decision-makers oversight over core operational data.

Effective admin panels eliminate the need for manual data entry, processing, and visualization. Instead, charts, reports, and tables are automatically created and updated. This gives your team an intuitive and fast platform for monitoring operations.

### Why do rental companies use admin panels?

Car rental companies have incredibly complex operational processes. One element of this is tracking and managing the usage and maintenance of thousands of vehicles. It’s crucial that every car in your fleet is serviced effectively and on time for the next vehicle rental term.

This is even more challenging for large fleets that are spread across multiple locations.

Additionally, car rental admin panels help to simplify and digitize your operations on the ground. Administrative and customer-facing teams benefit from intuitive and efficient tools for querying and manipulating data.

### What should a car rental admin panel include?

For rental companies, effective admin panels essentially contain two functions:

1. Visualization of key operational data,
2. Functionality for teams to add, manipulate, and edit data about vehicles and car bookings.

This includes mileage, fleet age, individual vehicle information, usage, car rental agreement terms, and maintenance data. It’s also vital that users can quickly visualize different data views. This might include isolating vehicles at different locations and maintenance intervals, or in different categories.

## Our car rental admin panel template

Our car rental template offers a fully custom and deployable admin panel, with minimal development time.

Like all Budibase apps, our car rental admin panel offers:

* Design customization.

### Simplify fleet management

Cut operational costs with more effective fleet management workflows. Our template allows users to quickly check vehicles in or out, and update key details, including their current mileage and location.

With our template, the rental processing is fast and cost-effective. Users can quickly search for any vehicle, and update its status at the press of a button. We’ve provided simple form interfaces for checking vehicles in and out or registering maintenance work.

When a vehicle has covered 10,000 miles since its last service, it’s automatically marked as due for servicing. This is indicated on the vehicle detail page, as well as the app’s home screen.

### Data visualization and reporting

Our car rental admin panel is built around a number of data visualization screens. Track and monitor age, mileage, maintenance, and usage data for individual vehicles, classes, or your fleet as a whole.

Our visualization screens are fully searchable. With Budibase, you have complete control over the filter views and search fields you include in your admin panel.

We’ve provided four separate data visualization screens, for different levels of analysis. Budibase offers complete customization over visualization and reports. Our template features a range of charts and graphs to visualize statistics on fleet age, servicing, and mileage.

### Cut operating costs

As your fleet management systems and processes become more efficient, your operating costs will drop. Our template is designed to improve profitability through better decision-making and more efficient admin processes.

Our admin panel makes it easy to spot trends and relationships between fleet data and operating costs. In turn, this empowers you to make data-driven decisions to minimize maintenance and logistics spending.

Our template also greatly reduces the time to process each rental. This reduces admin costs, as well as improving customer experiences.

Create automation rules which perfectly match your existing operating processes. We’ve set all vehicles to require maintenance every 10,000 miles. You can customize your maintenance notifications, with different time, mileage, or usage rules.

Add your SMTP credentials to automatically trigger email notifications when maintenance is required, eliminating the need for manual contact.

### Conditional UIs

Our template features conditional UIs to maximize usability. Use user information, behavior, vehicle data, or form inputs to automatically hide, display, or edit different design components. Use conditionality to tailor workflows and provide streamlined user experiences.

Our car rental admin panel uses conditionality to display warnings on vehicle detail pages when maintenance is needed.

With Budibase, conditionality can be added to any design element, based on a number of rules.

### Customize data fields

Of course, every business is different. With Budibase, you have complete control over your admin panel’s data fields. We’ve provided fields for the most common vehicle information, including mileage, age, make, model, VIN, license plate, location, and more.

With our simple low-code platform, you can quickly add new fields to your databases, [digital forms](https://budibase.com/forms), and visualizations.

As your business evolves to meet new challenges, customization is critical. With Budibase, your fleet management tools can easily grow and evolve with it.
