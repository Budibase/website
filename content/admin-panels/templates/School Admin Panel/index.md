Any education professional can tell you that administering a school is a massive challenge. One element of this is tracking and managing students’ attendance, and tardiness rates. Many schools fail to track this properly, then struggle to implement effective policies.

Beyond this, there’s the challenge of managing school finances. With ever-shrinking budgets and rising costs, financial oversight is crucial.

Our school management system template is built to solve these challenges for educational institutions.

## What is an admin panel?

Admin panels are simple tools for enabling college and school students and teachers to view, manipulate, and manage data. Of course, this can mean different things for different kinds of organizations - across schools and universities.

The key thing is that decision-makers should be able to quickly access key data.

The goal is to improve policy decision-making, while also cutting operational costs through streamlined admin processes.

### Why do schools use admin panels?

Admin panels solve several key educational challenges. Institutions at all levels struggle to make effective decisions, because of a lack of coherent and comprehensible data.

Most schools essentially use admin panels to track two kinds of data:

* Student behavior.
* School finances.

They might also include employee data or even functionality for managing assignments and grades. Using our template, you can easily and cost-effectively adopt a data-driven approach to internal policymaking.

### What should a school admin panel contain?

Of course, there is a wide variety of different data points which can be tracked within school admin panels. The core kinds of data for schools to track include:

* Attendance,
* Tardiness,
* Demographics,
* Total expenses,
* Categorized pending.

It’s also important for admin panels to track how these data points cross-cut. For instance, administrators should be able to quickly view attendance rates of different demographics, such as by gender or year group.

The best admin panels also contain additional features for streamlining admin tasks. These include automations and integrations with tools, including communications apps, calendars, and LMS systems.

## Our school admin panel template

Our template is designed to offer a fully custom and deployable admin panel, in minutes.

Like all Budibase apps, our school admin panel offers:

### Track student behavior

Use our template to track attendance and tardiness rates across all student demographics. We’ve provided a number of intuitive interfaces for viewing key datasets. From the app’s home screen, you can view data for the entire school, as well as by age or gender.

The same data fields can be tracked for individual students. Use the searchable drill-down screen to quickly view key information on individuals’ behavior.

Our template makes it easy to track student behavior at both a macro and micro level. This is crucial for allowing staff to make effective decisions, for individual pupils, year groups, or the school as a whole.

### Oversee expenses

One of the major challenges for educational leaders is managing and allocating resources effectively. In part, this stems from the fact that effective education involves such a wide variety of costs.

Our template provides a centralized resource for submitting, monitoring, and managing expenses. Individual staff members can quickly submit expenses, which are added to the overall spending figures in real-time.

On the expenses tracking page, users can view the school’s overall or categorized spending. On this screen, we’ve also provided a searchable table to find, view, and edit all individual submissions.

### Streamline admin processes

Our template is built to streamline admin processes, creating more efficient operations. As well as tracking behavior, we’ve provided functionality to record absences and tardiness. At the press of a button, users can mark students as absent or late.

Staff members can also submit new expenses requests using an intuitive and efficient form interface.

Give your staff admin tools that will save them time. Our school admin panel is designed to provide exceptional user experiences and drastically improve administrative workflows.

### Add conditionality

Budibase features powerful conditional UIs. Our template uses conditional formatting to make it easy to call and review different data sets. Use simple dropdown components to quickly access a number of filtered data views

Conditionality allows you to display different components or use different configuration options, depending on a number of factors. These include user information, behavior, form data, and more.

Use conditional interfaces to create intuitive interfaces that are fully optimized for your users’ needs.

### Workflow automation

Our template supports a wide range of workflow automations. Use any in-app action to trigger Budibase’s library of built-in automations. You can also use third-party integrations or our built-in JavaScript editor to create powerful custom automations.

With Budibase, you have complete control to set up automations based on existing processes and rules. For example, if you store parents’ email addresses, you can automatically notify them when students cross a set threshold of tardiness or absence.

Workflow automations in Budibase cut operational costs by simplifying key admin tasks. That way, your staff can get on with teaching.

### Custom data fields

Our school admin panel template is built around two databases, for student behavior and school finances. We’ve provided the most common data fields in our databases, [form interfaces](https://budibase.com/forms), and dashboards.

Like all Budibase tools, our template is fully customizable. Add, remove, or alter any data fields to perfectly match your organizational needs.
