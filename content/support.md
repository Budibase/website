Budibase provides community support by default, but extended support is available for Enterprise customers. 

---

#### Community support

As an open source platform, Budibase offers community support to everyone. This includes responding to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/issues), answering [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/issues), and chatting across a number of public channels on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZepTmGbtfF).

When interacting with community support you may receive help from either our Customer Success team, or another supportive community member. While this support is not obligated, the Budibase team endeavours to answer what we can, and all community contributions are appreciated! 

The GitHub repository is a good place to look for FAQs.

#### Business support

In addition to having all of the community resources available, users on the Business plan can contact support directly via email. This provides a private communication channel for support.

---

#### Enterprise support

The Enterprise tier provides your business with priority support and the reassurance of SLAs. Furthermore, an Account Manager will be assigned to assist with onboarding.

You can view the additional features included in Enterprise on the [pricing page](https://budibase.com/pricing/).
