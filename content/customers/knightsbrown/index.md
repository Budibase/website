Knights Brown is an independent construction and civil engineering company with a reputation for delivering exceptional projects in the UK, across both the public and private sectors. 

At the heart of their mission is a relentless focus on operational excellence and continuous improvement. 

Michael, the Head of IT at Knights Brown, plays a pivotal role in driving this mission forward. Tasked with ensuring that the company’s digital tools are as robust and forward-thinking as their construction projects, Michael is constantly on the lookout for solutions that enhance efficiency, streamline workflows, and empower teams across the company. **“Stakeholders in the business say “Here's a problem” and we find the best technical solution.”**

As the construction industry becomes increasingly digitized, Knights Brown faced a familiar challenge: how to replace outdated, manual processes with modern, intuitive systems that would not only meet their current needs but also scale with their future ambitions. 

This is where their journey with Budibase began.


#### The Paper-based Problem

Knights Brown’s initial challenge revolved around their outdated, paper-based ticketing system. Best practice hits, near misses, and suggestions for improvement were all recorded manually, leading to inefficiencies and under-use. Employees were reluctant to engage with the system, and crucial safety and operational data were at risk of being lost or overlooked. Michael recognized that to improve process adherence and data accuracy, the system needed to be digitized.

Their first attempt to solve this problem was through [Microsoft PowerApps](https://budibase.com/blog/alternatives/powerapps/). However, this solution proved to be cumbersome and visually unappealing. **“When we first had the issue, we thought, ‘Let’s use PowerApps,’”** Michael recalled, but the learning curve was steep and the platform didn’t meet their aesthetic or functional needs. **“It didn’t look as nice, and it took longer,”** Michael noted, underscoring the limitations that led them to search for an alternative solution.


#### The Search for a Better Way

Seeking a more user-friendly and efficient platform, Michael and his team turned to Budibase. Their first project with Budibase was to build the ticketing system mentioned previously, affectionately naming it **Tick-IT**.

**“We needed something that was easy to use and build. We’re not coders. We tried Budibase, had a proof of concept up within a day, and haven’t looked back,”** Michael explained. **“We find Budibase really intuitive… It was nice and easy to start with, and offered the power to edit the code underneath as well.”**

This wasn’t just theoretical — **“I think we went from trialing it on the web to downloading it, hosting it, getting our own custom domain on there. It only took a couple of hours, and it was all done and ready to use.”**

A critical requirement of this application was getting live data, which their previous solution was struggling to meet. **“One of the challenges with the previous attempt at digitizing the system was that every time we had a new job, someone needed to manually update the list so it appeared in the dropdown in the application, which sometimes resulted in people's sites not being available at the beginning of jobs.”**

**“With Budibase it integrates and gets the latest list of live projects.”**

The rapid deployment, live data, and intuitive interface of Budibase made it an immediate success. **“With paper, many people just didn’t want to use it,”** Michael shared. The digital shift encouraged greater participation, and the efficiency gains were evident from the start.


#### Going Beyond Ticketing with Budibase

Building on the success of the Tick-IT application, Knights Brown recognized the broader potential of Budibase and began exploring additional use cases across the organization. The flexibility and ease of use that Budibase offers allowed the team to rapidly develop and deploy two new applications:

1. Branded Clothing Ordering System: This app streamlined the process for staff to view catalogs, place orders, and specify delivery sites. The Buying Department could then efficiently create bulk orders, saving time and enhancing the company’s professional image. **“The clothing order system has saved a lot of time. We appear more professional rather than using pen and paper,”** Michael remarked.

1. Interactive Site Map: Knights Brown also developed an app that displayed all active worksites across the UK on an interactive map. Jobs were color-coded by division, and users could click on each job for more detailed information. **“Within a couple of hours of the data being input, the location of our live projects is displayed on a map. That’s really nice,”** Michael said, highlighting the efficiency and real-time accuracy of the system.

Each new application built with Budibase demonstrated the platform’s versatility, addressing unique challenges while improving overall operational efficiency. **“Once we built the first application, Budibase became another tool in our belt. The next time we had a challenge, we thought ‘Could this be done in Budibase?’”**.


#### Realizing the Impact

The impact of Budibase on Knights Brown’s operations has been substantial. The new systems not only saved time but also improved the accuracy and availability of critical data. For example, the Site Map’s integration with live project data eliminated the need for manual updates, ensuring that every site was visible from the start of a job.

Moreover, the reduced burden on service desks was a clear indicator of user satisfaction. **“The number of service desk instances we've had has decreased by at least 50%. People are using it, and it’s working, and they're not having to think about it; it’s not causing problems,”** Michael noted. The intuitive nature of Budibase means employees can focus on their tasks without being hindered by cumbersome processes.

Knights Brown’s commitment to continuous improvement is facilitated by Budibase’s ease of use, allowing Michael and his team to iterate and refine applications based on user feedback quickly. **“On one of the calls with the Budibase support team, we could build our app in real-time. When they said, ‘Can you change the font size of that’ or ‘Move that a little bit,’ I could just do it live right there and then. It’s really saved time in having to go back to them with different revisions,”** Michael explained.

This ability to make real-time adjustments has been a game-changer, enabling the IT team to respond swiftly to the needs of the organization.


#### A Future with Budibase

Knights Brown’s journey with Budibase has proven that the right tools can drive significant improvements in both efficiency and user satisfaction. The platform’s versatility, ease of use, and powerful features have made it an indispensable part of their IT toolkit. **“Budibase is another great tool to have in our toolbelt as an IT Department. It’s nice and easy to use, and being able to quickly get something from thought to proof-of-concept is invaluable,”** Michael emphasized.

As Knights Brown continues to grow and face new challenges, Budibase will remain a key partner in their digital transformation. **“Since upgrading to Enterprise, we’re starting to feel more comfortable using Budibase for more critical business systems,”** Michael concluded. With Budibase, Knights Brown is well-equipped to continue their journey toward greater innovation and efficiency, confident in their ability to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing industry.
