Budibase has been a great introduction; it allowed us to answer business requirements quickly and resolve the company's unhealthy dependency on spreadsheets.

Centralization of authentication, quick turnaround time for requests, integration with different database systems has given it the edge and it's now used daily for internal development for those apps that you know you need but don't feel value in losing days of development to reinvent the wheel.

Those same apps, with Budibase, are now here in less than an hour. Colleagues were stunned by the data import functionality, seeing a sheet turn into a web app in minutes was the cherry on top.

Budibase is a must-have platform for any IT department.
