## The Role
We are looking for a Full Stack JavaScript engineer who is passionate about all parts of the web app development process. The term “Full Stack” is thrown around a lot, so when we say “Full Stack”, what we mean is someone who has had exposure to frontend and backend web development. Everyone has a specialty, and we do not expect candidates to be experts in both.

We welcome people from all backgrounds and walks of life. Budibase is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status. 

As a fast growing startup, we are committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion early on. We would particularly welcome applications from women. 

If successful, you will have the opportunity to:
- Work on one of the fastest growing open source projects **in the world** in an extremely exciting market.
- Be the customer - Develop a product that you can use
- Have a large impact and input in the direction of the product and company
- Huge opportunities for growth both technically and professionally
- Work closely with design and engineering to deliver a fantastic user experience for our customers
- Opportunities to cross train into frontend, backend or infrastructure if it’s not your primary area of expertise
- Take ownership of parts of the product and codebase
- Present your ideas in a clear and effective manner to the rest of the team
- Be an integral player as part of a small development team
- Help manage and implement processes that make Budibase a fantastic place to work
- Write and test code across the stack - every day.
- Take an active part in building a global community

## Interview Process
At Budibase, we do **not** believe in making candidates demonstrate an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of programming syntax from memory in the form of whiteboard tests or direct question interviews. As engineers, we all use google every day to solve problems - we see whiteboard interviews as a test of your recall and not your technical ability.

Our process is a simple one and is set up to highlight the strengths of our candidates.  A tech interview should be a two way street between the candidate and the company.

**Step 1: Initial chat with Budibase**
One of us will jump on a call for a virtual coffee with you and discuss the role, answering any questions you may have about us.

**Step 2: Technical Interview**
Our technical interview lasts 1 hour, and comes in 2 parts:
- The first half is a discussion about your favourite technology stack, and why you love it. This is always an interesting discussion and we always enjoy talking tech with our candidates!
- The second half involves the design of a software system. We will give you a hypothetical product spec, and ask how you would go about designing the software from a high level. From there, we will ask more about certain parts of your design and introduce some constraints on the system.

We let candidates know the result of the interview either way soon after.
