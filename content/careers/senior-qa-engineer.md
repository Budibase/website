## Interview Process
At Budibase, we do **not** believe in making candidates demonstrate an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of programming syntax from memory in the form of whiteboard tests or direct question interviews. As engineers, we all use google every day to solve problems - we see whiteboard interviews as a test of your recall and not your technical ability.

Our process is a simple one and is set up to highlight the strengths of our candidates.  A tech interview should be a two way street between the candidate and the company.

**Step 1: Initial chat with Budibase**
One of us will jump on a call for a virtual coffee with you and discuss the role, answering any questions you may have about us.

**Step 2: Technical Interview**
Our technical interview lasts 1 hour, and comes in 2 parts:
- The first half is a discussion about your favourite technology stack, and why you love it. This is always an interesting discussion and we always enjoy talking tech with our candidates!
- The second half involves the design of a software system. We will give you a hypothetical product spec, and ask how you would go about testing the software from a high level. From there, we will ask more about certain parts of your test plan and introduce some constraints on the system.

We let candidates know the result of the interview either way soon after.
