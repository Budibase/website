Delivering patient care requires a huge amount of administrative work. This begins with the admissions process.

Of course, hospital administration can be a massive drain on your finances. This includes day-to-day costs, like employee wages and equipment, as well as hidden costs, such as miscommunication, inefficient processes, and poor information management.

For modern healthcare providers, digitization is crucial. Our patient intake form is built to optimize, automate, and eliminate manual admin workflows.

## What is a digital form?

Digital forms are dedicated tools for collecting, storing, and managing data. In healthcare settings, this may include patients’ personal information, admission details, emergency contacts, insurance details, medical history, and more.

The goal is to reduce admin workloads, improve accuracy, and facilitate process automation.

In most hospitals, patients still provide their information using pen and paper. Then, a member of your team manually enters this into your computer system. This leads to a large volume of redundant administrative work.

### Why digitize hospital admissions?

Digital transformation cuts operational costs, allowing you to divert resources towards patient care. Even minor inefficiencies in your admissions workflows can create massive expenditure over the long term.

Digital forms provide a basis for process automation, as well as improving accuracy, eliminating risk, and reducing the scope for human error.

By collecting patient data digitally, you can ensure that the correct information is gathered, as efficiently as possible.

### What should a hospital admission form tool contain?

Digital patient forms are built around two key elements:

* A **front-end interface** for submitting, managing, and accessing admissions data.
* A **back-end data layer** for storing patient information.

When patients or team members complete your admissions form, a new entry is created in the back-end database. Your team can also search, access, and manage patient information, using the app’s front-end.

The most effective patient intake tools offer additional functionality for automating workflows, integrating with external tools, improving oversight, and maximizing efficiency.

## Our hospital admission form template

Our hospital admission form template is built for maximum usability, efficiency, and automation. Collect, store, sort, and manage patient data, with our free, deployable template.

Budibase is the fast, cost-effective way to build custom tools. Use our template as a deployable solution, or tweak and customize it to fully meet your requirements.

### Intuitive, multi-step intake forms

Our template is built around an intuitive, multi-step admissions form. At each stage, users are guided through a specific category of information. For instance, personal details, emergency contact information, medical needs, and consent to terms of treatment.

We’ve provided clear, descriptive labels, ensuring that patients provide accurate information, in the correct format.

With conditional UIs, simple text fields, options pickers, and date selectors, our [form interfaces](https://budibase.com/forms) are designed to maximize efficiency during patient intake.

### Custom data fields

Budibase offers complete customization. Add, remove, or edit data fields, to suit your specific requirements. Use our autogenerated forms to update interfaces to match your new data fields, at the press of a button.

Our leading low-code platform offers a wide range of variables. Add simple text or number fields, options pickers, attachments, date selectors, rich-text, boolean data, relationship pickers, JSON objects, and formula variables.

With Budibase, it’s easy to fully customize your patient intake forms, in a matter of seconds.

### Workflow automation

Our template is the perfect platform for automating patient intake workflows. Use any in-app action to trigger Budibase’s vast library of built-in automations. Build custom automation, using handlebars expressions, JavaScript, third-party integrations, and formula variables.

We’ve provided a simple formula variable to determine patients who are under 18 years of old. This facilitates additional data gathering and confirmation of parental consent.

Our template also offers functionality for contacting patients directly, using the _mailto:_ command. Add your SMTP credentials to trigger automated emails from within Budibase tools.

### Role-based access control

Budibase offers fully customizable role-based access control. Use any attribute to assign different levels of access to different users. Configure apps screens to be accessible from any permission tier, at the press of a button.

We’ve built our template around two permission tiers. _Public_ users can provide their details by completing your admission form. Your internal team can then search, access, manage, and edit this data.

At Budibase, we empower our users to create the perfect access hierarchies for their needs. Use our custom RBAC to maximize both usability and security, by giving users access to the exact features they need.

### Mobile-friendly design

Our hospital admission form template works perfectly on all devices. Design elements automatically scale and resize to fit perfectly on users’ screens. Our components and blocks are also fully tested for key accessibility standards.

Use our template on your internal devices, or allow patients to complete forms on their own phones and tablets.

Budibase is the perfect way to build web applications and internal tools.

### Searchability and dynamic filtering

Manage patient data with our advanced searchability and filtering. We’ve provided a dedicated _patient_ management screen. Use our dynamic filter component to find entries, using any combination of variables.

Use simple _equals_, _starts with, ends with_, or numerical expressions to filter and isolate data.

Budibase also offers static formula variables for categorizing data and creating automated taxonomies, with JavaScript and handlebars expressions.

### Conditional UIs

Budibase offers powerful conditional UIs. Hide, display, or update any design element based on user data, form inputs, existing form completions, formula variables, and more. Conditionality is the perfect way to create fully optimized patient intake experiences.

We’ve used conditional UIs to update interfaces when patients are under 18 years old. Intake forms are updated to require a parent or guardian’s details. Listings screens are updated to notify users that they’re viewing the details of a minor.

Add conditionality rules to any design component in seconds, using dropdown menus, handlebars, or JavaScript.
