Manage communications, admin tasks, and patient relationships, in a single intuitive tool.

In healthcare settings, administrative work can be a huge drain on resources. On the one hand, there’s the burden this puts on your admin team. On the other, there are hidden costs, including human error, miscommunication, and inefficiencies.

Digital transformation is the most effective way to eliminate excessive admin burdens. Use our simple form to digitalize hospital discharges and reduce operating costs.

## What is a hospital discharge form?

Discharge forms are used to record, summarize, and share patients’ treatment information. For instance, information on original symptoms, testing, diagnosis, and interventions. This information might be used internally, or by patients and other healthcare providers.

In other words, the goal of a discharge form is to create a paper trail of the care patients receive during their hospital stay, as well as their ongoing needs.

As well as providing information for patients and other healthcare providers, this helps to ensure accountability within your hospital.

### Why digitize hospital discharges?

Hospitals around the world still rely on paper forms for managing patient information. As well as creating large amounts of paperwork, this leads to poor patient experiences, miscommunication, and unnecessary risk.

Digitalizing your discharge process opens up countless opportunities for automation, cost reduction, and improved record-keeping.

Eliminate manual admin tasks, automate communications, and free up resources to allocate to critical patient care. Our hospital discharge form template is built to maximize efficiency.

### What should a hospital discharge tool contain?

At a basic level, [digital forms](https://budibase.com/forms) contain two elements:

1. A front-end interface for collecting patient information.
2. A back-end data layer for storing, categorizing, and managing patient data.

When a user completes a discharge form, the patient’s information is stored in the database. This can then be accessed, shared, and managed by other users.

The most effective digital forms offer additional functionality for eliminating admin tasks, automating workflows, and improving oversight. For instance, third-party integrations, custom automation rules, and more.
