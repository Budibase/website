## Part 1 – Premium SOFTWARE terms 


### 1. Introduction

1.1 Part 1 of these terms sets out the licence terms applicable to any source-available software you download from us unless you have entered into a separate written contract with us. Additional terms are set out in Part 2 below, which only apply to any services we provide in relation to self-hosted software. 

1.2 Different terms apply:

a) for our hosted software offering (where you access our software as a service), or we provide you associated services, which are set out at: [https://budibase.com/terms-of-service](https://budibase.com/terms-of-service); or 

b) where you download and use our open-source software without premium features, and you are not on an enhanced liability package. In that case we provide such open-source software under open-source terms, which are set out at: [https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/blob/develop/LICENSE](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/blob/develop/LICENSE). If you have downloaded our open-source software on that basis, but require services for that software, the terms in Part 2 below shall apply, but this Part 1 will not apply. 

1.3 These terms are published on our website and you should save a copy of for your records.  We may amend them from time to time by publishing a new version on our website. Any changes will not apply retrospectively to software you have already downloaded. This version one of these terms was published on 9th November 2021. You can obtain historic versions by contacting us. 


### 2. Acceptance

2.1 By downloading or using our source-available software, you agree to the provisions in Part 1 of these terms and are deemed to have accepted the source-available software.


### 3. SOFTWARE Licence

3.1 BB grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable licence to permit your authorised users to use, copy, modify, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of our source-available software to create your own bespoke software applications, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions in Part 1 of these terms. 

3.2 BB additionally grants you a licence, under any legal claims BB can licence, including patent claims, or becomes able to licence, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and have imported software application you have created using our source-available software, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions in these terms. This licence does not cover any patent, copyright or other intellectual property claims that you cause to be infringed by modifications or additions to our source-available software. If you or your company make any written claim that the source-available software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right, your licence for the source-available software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your licence ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

3.3 BB shall, from time to time, as part of your licence for the source-available software make available new upgrades of the software as it generally releases to all customers (but software containing any substantially new features or functionality may be marketed and licensed as a separate product), which you will have the option to download and use. You acknowledge that such updates may impact your use of the source-available software.  


### 4. SOFTWARE LICENCE restrictions

4.1 You may not provide our source-available software to third parties as a hosted or managed service, where the service provides users with access to any substantial set of the features or functionality of our source-available software. This includes a restriction on distributing, commercialising or licensing the source-available software or a substantial set or part of its features or functions in any way (whether for payment or otherwise) which might undermine or compete with the software and services offered by BB (i.e., the provision of an open source low-code or no-code platform or product, which provides customers with a means to create their own bespoke software applications). Generally, you must not access any part of the source-available software to build, or to facilitate the building of, a product or service which competes with source-available software (and you may not access the source available software if you, your company or any of your authorised users are, or are planning to, build any such product or service). Further, during the subscription term, and 12 months thereafter (or the longest period enforceable under relevant law), you shall not, or attempt to, build or develop any product or service that commercially competes with or is substantially similar to the source-available software, which you or your company provides or intends to provide to third parties for payment (i.e., which is not solely intended for internal use). This obligation shall cease to apply only where there is no longer a commercial relationship between the parties, and you can demonstrate that (a) an independent third party has licenced or sold some similar software to you on arms’ length terms, and (b) such solutions do not incorporate or contain, are not based upon, and do not rely in any way upon any confidential information made available by BB to you, or to which you or your authorised users otherwise gained access, under these terms or any previous contract between the parties.

4.2 You may not move, change, disable, or circumvent the licence key functionality in the source-available software, and you may not remove or obscure any features or functionality in the source-available software that are protected by the licence key or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorised access to the source-available software.

4.3 You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of BB in the source-available software. 


### 5. YOUR GENERAL OBLIGATIONS 

5.1 You agree to exercise your rights and comply with your obligations under these terms in accordance with all relevant laws in the UK, USA and the jurisdiction where you are incorporated, registered or reside, including any applicable export control laws, and you must not use the source-available software in any way which (a) is unlawful, harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, infringing, harassing or racially or ethnically offensive; (b) facilitates illegal activity; (c) depicts sexually explicit images; (d) promotes unlawful violence; (e) is discriminatory based on race, gender, colour, religious belief, sexual orientation, disability, or any other illegal activity; or (f) causes damage or injury to any person or property. 

5.2 Any information you provide us must be complete, accurate and not misleading, and you will inform us if it changes during the term. You acknowledge we may rely on such information without seeking to establish its reliability.

5.5 You shall use best endeavours to prevent any unauthorised access to, or use of, the source-available software and promptly notify us of any unauthorised access or use.

5.6 You agree you are solely responsible for you and your authorised users’ use of the source-available software, including ensuring that they are adequately trained to use the source-available software, and that your network and systems, software and hardware are all appropriate to enable to them to access and use the source-available software and services.

### 7. THIRD PARTY TERMS

7.1 our software may from time to time include or feature third party and open-source software components which are subject to certain third party and open source licence terms, and so any terms and conditions set out at [https://budibase.com/licences](https://budibase.com/licences) or incorporated into the source-available software codebase, as updated from time to time (without further notice) shall apply to your and your company’s use of the source-available software in addition to the rest of these terms. We do not use any open-source software distributed under copyleft terms, and none of the open-source software we use requires any onwards users of the relevant software to pay a fee, provided you comply with the relevant terms.

7.2 Additionally, where you choose to do so, you may use third-party services when accessing the source-available software, for example where you download an application that integrates with the source-available software. While these terms govern use of the source-available software, other parties’ terms govern the third-party services. BB does not control any third-party services and disclaims and will have no liability regarding such services, or your or your company’s use of same. You agree you and your company will not hold BB responsible for any use of third-party services (or interactions with third parties) and that BB cannot be held responsible for any errors or issues with the source-available software where attributable to such third-party services. 


### 8. Notices

8.1 You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the source-available software from you also gets an exact copy of these terms and agrees to abide by them (other than the obligations to pay us relevant charges). Each time you do so, the recipient automatically receives a licence from Budibase on the same basis as set out in these terms. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with these terms.

8.2 If you modify the source-available software, you must include in any modified copies of the source-available software prominent notices stating that you have modified the source-available software.


### 9. WARRANTIES

9.1 BB warrants that the source-available software shall conform in all material respects to the specification for a period of 90 days from the relevant commencement date for your licence (the warranty period). Otherwise, BB gives no warranties in relation to the source-available software. If, within the warranty period, you notify BB in writing of any defect or fault in the source-available software in consequence of which it fails to conform in all material respects to the specification, and the warranty is not excluded under clauses 9.2 or 9.3, we shall, at our option, do one of the following: (a) repair the source-available software; (b) replace the source-available software; or (c) terminate the agreement between us immediately by notice in writing to you and refund any of the charges paid by you as at the date of termination (less a reasonable sum calculated by us in our discretion in respect of your use of the source-available software to the date of termination) on return of the source-available software and all copies thereof, provided always that you provide all the information we reasonably require to assist us in resolving the defect or fault, including a documented example of any defect or fault, or sufficient information to enable us to re-create same. Such remedy shall constitute your sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of such warranty.

9.2 The warranty at clause 9.1 shall not apply to the extent of any non-conformance which is caused by (a) use of the source-available software contrary to BB’s instructions or otherwise than as permitted by these terms, (b) modification or alteration of the source-available software or services by any party other than BB or BB’s duly authorised contractors or agents, without BB’s written consent; (c) use of the source-available software for a purpose or in a context other than the purpose or context for which it was designed (d) issues with your equipment; (e) interaction of the source-available software with other software programmes or plugins not provided by us; or (f) anything otherwise outside our reasonable control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BB does not warrant that your use of the source-available software will be uninterrupted or error-free.

9.3 The undertaking in clause 9.1 shall not apply to the free software, and you acknowledge that where you use free software it may be subject to change without notice and you do so at your own risk. We give no warranties, and to the extent permitted by law, accept no liabilities regarding the free software and its use by you or any authorised users. Access to the free software is permitted temporarily, and BB may suspend or withdraw your licence or change all or any part of the free software at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. You acknowledge and agrees that access and use of any free software constitutes sufficient consideration in return for which you are willing to adhere to the terms of these terms.  

9.4 BB also warrants that the source-available software made available by us for download shall be free from any virus (provided we shall not be responsible for the integrity or security of any networks over which the source-available software may be downloaded). 


### 10. INDEMNITY 

10.1 The parties will defend each other against third-party disputes, complaints, claims, actions, proceedings (together claims), as and to the extent set out in this clause 10.. They will meet any losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation court costs and reasonable legal fees) (together liabilities) resulting from a final adverse judgment or approved settlement in respect of such claims, provided that if any third party makes a claim, or notifies an intention to make a claim, against a party seeking indemnification (via the indemnified party) which may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a liability under an indemnity, the indemnified party shall: (a) as soon as reasonably practicable, provide written notice of the claim to the party from whom it is seeking the indemnity (via the indemnifying party), specifying the nature of the claim in reasonable detail (provided that failure to do so shall not prejudice the indemnifying party’s obligation to indemnify unless to the extent their defence of any claim is subject to any material prejudice); (b) not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise concerning the claim without the prior written consent of indemnifying party (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed); (c) give indemnifying party and its professional adviser’s copies (on reasonable prior notice) of any documents and records within the power or control of indemnified party of relevance to the claim to assess the claim; and (d) be deemed to have given to indemnifying party sole authority to avoid, dispute, compromise, or defend the claim, provided that (i) the indemnifying party shall not make any admission of liability or compromise concerning any claim where this entails any liabilities for, or acknowledgement of fault by, the indemnified party without the indemnified party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), and (ii) the indemnified party shall have a right to participate in such defence or dispute of any claim using a legal advisor of its choice, at its own cost and expense, and shall, either way, be kept reasonably appraised as to the progress of the defence of any claim by the indemnifying party or its legal advisor.

10.2 This clause 10. describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability regarding any claims as and to the extent set out in this clause 10.. 

10.3 Subject to clause 10.1, BB will defend you against any claim brought by an unaffiliated third party to the extent it alleges your authorised use of the source-available software infringes a copyright, patent, or trademark or misappropriates a trade secret of an unaffiliated third party. If BB is unable to resolve any such claim under commercially reasonable terms, we may, at our option, either: (a) modify, repair, or replace the relevant infringing element of the source-available software (as applicable); or (b) terminate your licence and refund any prepaid, unused licence fee (less a deduction to reflect usage to date). BB will have no obligation under this clause for any such claim arising from: (i) the modification of the source-available software, or the combination, operation, or use of the source-available software with equipment, devices, software, systems, or data; (ii) your failure to stop using the allegedly infringing software after receiving notice to do so; (iii) a breach your obligations under these terms; (iv) access or use of free software. For purposes of BB’s obligation under this clause, the source-available software includes third-party software components incorporated by BB in its codebase. This clause 10.3 states your sole and exclusive rights and remedies, and BB’s (including its Representatives and Affiliates) entire obligations and liability, for infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, database right or right of confidentiality.

10.4 Subject to clause 10.1, you will defend, indemnify and hold harmless BB against any claim brought by a third party against BB, arising from or in respect of (a) your or your authorised users’ breach of these terms; (b) any third party-branded equipment, devices, software, systems, or data that you combine, operate, or use with the source-available software; or (c) any use by you or your authorised users of the source-available software (save to the extent attributable to BB’s breach of these terms); including any additional liabilities you may take on in relation to the source-available software (whether or not consistent with these terms) (in respect of which you may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on our behalf). 

**THE FOLLOWING CLAUSES APPLY TO BOTH THE SOURCE-AVAILABLE SOFTWARE UNDER PART 1, AND THE SERVICES UNDER PART 2**

11.2 If you are paying by direct debit, credit card, or other online payment methods, you authorise BB to charge any relevant card or account for all charges payable. You further authorise BB to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party. 

11.3 If BB has not received payment of any charges due and owing under these terms within ten (10) days after the due date, without prejudice to any of its other rights and remedies: (a) BB may suspend provision of services while the invoice(s) remain unpaid; and (b) interest shall accrue on such due amounts at an annual rate equal to 4% over the then current base lending rate of HSBC plc at the date the relevant invoice was issued, compounded monthly, commencing on the due date and continuing until fully paid, whether before or after judgment (or the highest rate permitted by applicable law). BB also reserves the right to charge you reasonable administration costs, including charges for failed payments and/or its costs in relation to pursuing outstanding amounts (including legal fees and expenses), where we are not satisfied (in our sole discretion) that you have not acted reasonably and in good faith in disputing any amount due and owing.

11.5 You are solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on BB’s net income or gross revenue) imposed or become due in connection with the provision of source-available software or services to you under these terms. If you are located in the EU, you must provide BB with the VAT registration number under which you are registered in your member state.  If you do not provide BB with a VAT registration number prior to your transaction being processed, BB will not issue refunds or credits for any VAT that was charged.

11.6 If you are required to deduct or withhold any tax, you must pay the amount deducted or withheld as required by law and pay BB an additional amount so that BB receives payment in full as if there were no deduction or withholding.

11.7 Other than the documents, which BB makes available for all users, no training shall be provided in respect of the source-available software, other than as a chargeable consultancy service.

12.2 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies to which the parties may be entitled, either party may terminate the agreement between the parties if: (a) the other party commits a material breach of any of the terms of these terms and (if such a breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within 30 days of that party being notified in writing of the breach; or (b)  an order is made or a resolution is passed for the winding up of the other party or if an order is made for the appointment of an administrator to manage the affairs, business and property of the other party, or if such an administrator is appointed or if documents are filed with the court for the appointment of an administrator or if notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given by the other party or its directors or by a qualifying charge holder, or if a receiver is appointed of any of the other party’s assets or undertaking or if circumstances arise which entitle the court or a creditor to appoint a receiver or manager or which entitle the court to make a winding-up order or if the other party takes or suffers any similar or analogous action in consequence of debt; or (c) the other party ceases, or threatens to cease, to trade. 

12.3 BB may also terminate the agreement between the parties: (a) for cause on fourteen (14) days’ notice if BB determines that you are acting, or has acted, in a way that has or may negatively reflect on or affect BB, BB’s prospects, or BB’s customers; (b) immediately, if you have persistently breached these terms. 

12.4 Save as specified in these terms, and to the extent permitted by law, these terms may not otherwise be terminated prior to the end of the subscription term. 

12.5 The subscription term for any free trial shall continue from the relevant commencement date, unless and until terminated at any time by either party on written notice to the other, or automatically on expiry of the period specified for the free trial in the proposal or during the checkout process.

Fees are otherwise non-refundable. 

12.9 If BB has terminated the agreement for cause, you shall promptly pay all unpaid fees due through the end of any prepaid subscription term for source-available software and/or any applicable services. 


### 13. Disclaimer of warranty, limitation of Liability, and accepting additional liability– IMPORTANT 

13.1 This clause sets out BB’s (including its employees, agents and sub-contractors) entire financial liability to you in respect of: (a) any breach of these terms (including without limitation, any claim by you under clause 10.); (b) any use made by you of the self-hosted software, services or any part of them; and (c) any representation, statement or tortious act or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with these terms.

13.2 Except as expressly provided in these terms: (a) all warranties, representations, conditions and all other terms of any kind whatsoever implied by statute or common law are, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, excluded from these terms, including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement; (b) the services, documents and all other goods provided by BB, including any data output from same, are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis; and (c) you assume sole responsibility for the use of the self-hosted software by you and your authorised users, and for conclusions drawn from such use, including any software you develop using the self-hosted software. We shall have no liability for any damage caused by errors or omissions in any information, instructions or data provided by you hereunder, or any actions taken by us at your direction.    

13.3 BB does not warrant that the self-hosted software or services will meet your requirements; that your use of same will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the self-hosted software is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the self-hosted software or output of services are or will be free of viruses or other harmful components. BB will not be responsible for any risk of loss resulting from your downloading or using files, information, data or other material obtained using the self-hosted software.

13.4 Nothing in these terms excludes our liability: (a) for death or personal injury caused by BB’s negligence; or (b) for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any other liability which cannot strictly be excluded or limited by relevant law. 

**13.5 Subject to clauses 13.2 and 13.4, BB shall not be liable whether in tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory duty), contract, misrepresentation, restitution or any other kind of legal claim, howsoever arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of these terms, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages: (a) for any loss of profits, loss of business, depletion of goodwill and/or similar losses or loss or corruption of data or information, or pure economic loss, or for any special, indirect or consequential loss, costs, damages, charges or expenses however arising under these terms; (b) for an aggregate liability in excess of (i) the total charges paid during the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the claim arose; or (ii) zero, in respect of any free software or third-party services only, having regard to the free of charge nature of the free software, and the fact that we do not provide the third-party services. **

13.6 You acknowledge and accept that: (a) the source-available software and services have not been developed to meet your requirements, and that it is your sole responsibility to ensure that the functions of both meet such requirements (including any legal requirements to which your company, or the software tools and protocols (collectively tools) you develop using the source-available software, may be subject). In particular, you acknowledge that the self-hosted software simply provides a platform permitting your authorised users to develop such tools for your company’s purposes; (b) we shall have no liability or responsibility for such tools, (c) the outcomes of your use of the source-available software and services cannot be guaranteed and you shall be solely responsible for same; (d) we do not warrant or represent that the source-available software or services are compliant with, or which may be relevant to the purposes for which the tools may be used or intended; (b) the nature of the self-hosted software is such that it attempts to assist you in software development processes, but results and outcomes cannot be in any guaranteed, and these outcomes or results are entirely outside of BB’s control, and something for which you, not BB, is solely responsible and liable; (c) the self-hosted software and their BB is not responsible or liable for human error and negligent or fraudulent use of the self-hosted software and the use and interpretation of the self-hosted software requires specialist skill and knowledge. You warrant and undertakes that its authorised users have and will exercise same, and appropriate judgment, when using the self-hosted software.

13.7 You acknowledge and accept that the above limitations, and those outlined elsewhere in these terms, are fair, proportionate and reasonable in light of, among other things, the nature of the self-hosted software (including the acknowledgements outlined in this clause).

### 14. GENERAL TERMS 

14.1 We shall have no liability to you if we are prevented from or delayed in performing our obligations under these terms, or from carrying on our business, by acts, events, omissions or accidents beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes (whether involving the workforce of BB or any other party), failure of a utility service or transport or telecommunications network, act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation or direction, accident, breakdown of plant or machinery, fire, flood, storm or default of suppliers or sub-contractors, provided that you are notified of such an event and its expected duration.

14.2 A waiver of any right under these terms is only effective if it is in writing and it applies only to the party to whom the waiver is addressed and to the circumstances for which it is given. No delay in exercising any right or remedy or failure to object will be a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion will not be a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.

14.3 Unless specifically provided otherwise, rights arising under these terms are cumulative and do not exclude rights provided by law.

14.4 If any provision (or part of a provision) of these terms is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in force. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the commercial intention of the parties.

14.5 These terms, and any documents referred to in them, constitute the whole agreement between the parties and supersede any previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between them relating to their subject matter, to the exclusion of any terms introduced by you, through custom, dealing or otherwise. Our obligations are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features of the source-available software or services or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by BB regarding same.

14.6 You shall not, without our prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), assign, transfer, charge, sub-contract or deal in any other manner with all or any of your rights or obligations under these terms. BB shall be free to assign, transfer, charge, sub-contract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under these terms without your consent but providing notice of any assignment or transfer. We may also appoint a suitably qualified sub-contractor to perform or provide certain services on its behalf. You shall not be liable directly for any of the subcontractor’s fees or expenses and we shall remain responsible for the performance by our sub-contractor of any sub-contracted services. 

14.7 Nothing in these terms is intended to or shall operate to create a partnership between the parties or authorise either party to act as agent for the other, and neither party shall have the authority to act in the name or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including, but not limited to, the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power).

14.8 Notwithstanding any other provisions of these terms, nothing in these terms confers or purports to confer any right to enforce any of its terms on any person who is not a party to it, and any such person shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (or otherwise) to enforce any term of these terms.

14.9 Any notice required or permitted to be given under these terms shall be in writing and shall be delivered or transmitted to the intended recipient's address as specified in these terms or such other address as either party may notify in writing to the other from time to time for this purpose.

14.11 Where any proposal is issued or signed it may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together will constitute the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed valid proposal (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission, or signature via DocuSign or other EIDAS compliant signature platform, or your confirmation by email of its agreement to the terms of a valid proposal, shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of these terms.

14.12 Similarly, the completion of the checkout process by you or on your behalf (including by click- through or other acceptance method) and acceptance of your proposal by BB (either or by email confirmation) shall also be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of these terms. The provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, or any substantially similar legislation as enacted and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not govern these terms or the rights and obligations of the parties under them.

14.13 All services, these terms and any correspondence between the parties regarding their subject matter (including any dispute) shall be exclusively in the English language. BB might make versions of these terms available in languages other than English. If it does, the English version will govern the parties’ relationship. The translated version is provided for convenience only and will not modify the English version. 

14.14 Unless otherwise stated in these terms, no amendment or variation of these terms shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the parties (or their authorised representatives). This notwithstanding, BB may update and change any part or all of these terms (other than those relating to fees and charges) at any time. If we update or change these terms or any other document comprising part of these terms, and the updated document will be posted at the URL at which you originally accessed it and BB will let you know via email or through a pop-up notification when using the self-hosted software. The updated document will become effective and binding on the next business day after notice of any update is so given. When we change any document, the "Last Updated" date and version reference in the relevant document (e.g., clause 1.3 of these terms) will be updated to reflect the date of the most recent version. BB encourages you to review the documents forming part of these terms periodically. Every time you complete the checkout process, or sign a new proposal, the terms applying to these terms between the parties shall be as outlined in the relevant version of these terms at the time.

14.15 Each party (including in your case, the person completing the checkout process or signing the proposal in their individual capacity) represents and warrants to the other that it has full power and authority to enter into these terms (or to act on behalf of the party on whose behalf it purports to act) and that it is binding upon such party and enforceable in accordance with its terms.
