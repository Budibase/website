Connect Budibase to OIDC to implement SSO.

OIDC is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol. As a user, you will have infinite possibilities for SSO, including:

- Active Directory
- Auth0
- Azure
- Okta
- OneLogin
- It’s also possible to add your own authentication!

I know many of you will understand the benefits of SSO and OIDC, but here’s a quick recap:
No more password management
Auto-provisioning for users
Minimize password security risks
Quicker sign up/sign-in process for users
Use your SSO provider to control who can access Budibase
