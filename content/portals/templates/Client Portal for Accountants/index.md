For accountancy firms, one of the biggest operational costs is client communications. Extensive back and forth with clients can quickly lead to a large burden on admin teams. In turn, this undermines profitability.

One solution is to give clients a secure and efficient platform for managing files, information, and data. This streamlines communications and empowers customers to take control over their own admin needs.

## What is a client portal?

A client portal is a secure, private platform, where clients can manage key admin tasks. Users can edit their details, submit information, and view documents that have been shared with them.

Beyond this basic functionality client portals often have more specific features, depending on the business’ specific requirements. Given that accountants handle sensitive information, the core requirement of a client portal is securely storing and sharing files.

### Why do accountancy businesses use client portals?

Accounting firms use client portals to reduce operational costs, cut admin time, and provide better client experiences. As accountancy companies grow, it quickly becomes necessary to centralize admin and communication workflows, to remain profitable.

Additionally, digital portals provide improved client experiences. Rather than needing to contact your team, clients can simply access all of their documentation in one convenient location.

### What should a client portal for accountants contain?

Client portals for accountants are primarily used for secure file transfer and document management. They should also streamline key admin and communications processes.

This includes:

* Submission of documents,
* Information requests,
* Changes of details,
* And more.

Client portals are most effective when they closely match your existing internal processes.

## Our client portal for accountants

Our client portal for accountants is designed to reduce admin time, and provide incredible client experiences.

Our template offers:

* Customizable design.
* Client service workflows.
* Automations.
* Intuitive UI.
* Tiered permissions.
* External database support.
* Responsive design.
* Flexible hosting & deployment.
* Third-party integrations.
* Secure file transfers.

Use our open-source, low-code platform to build deployable client portals, in minutes.

### Self-service admin tools

Our client portal template empowers users to take control of their own accounts. The template is built around three data sets, for _document submissions, document requests_, and _client information._

Users can manipulate and query each of these databases, through intuitive and user-friendly app screens.

Allow your clients to view project files and change their information, anywhere, at any time.

### Document storage, transfer, and requests

Document management is one of the major challenges for accounting firms. One element of this is security. Countless firms rely on unsecured file-sharing tools, with many simply using email attachments to send documents.

Beyond this, there’s the challenge of centralizing information. Any accountant will tell you that clients often request the same information, time and time again.

Using a client portal for file management solves both of these problems. Our portal template allows your clients to send, receive, view, and request different kinds of documents, in a single, intuitive location.

### Workflow automation

Client portals enable accountants to automate key workflows. These days, accountancy is a heavily automated field. Creating an effective client portal is the first step towards creating efficient, automated admin processes.

Budibase offers a vast library of built-in automations for querying and manipulating data. Automations can be triggered from any action within our template. Use third-party integrations to trigger automations in external tools.

Our low-code platform also offers a built-in JavaScript editor. Build custom automations, to perfectly match even the most complex internal processes.

### Streamlined communications

A client portal for accountants is a powerful tool for streamlining communications. Our portal template eliminates most common client interactions, providing a secure platform to send and request documentation.

Add your SMTP credentials to send email notifications to your clients when their project changes or a new file is added.

Our template also offers a convenient platform for your internal team to find and contact clients. Under the admin panel, each client’s contact information is detailed. We’ve even provided functionality to quickly email clients, using the _mailto_ command.

Check out our [call-back form template](https://budibase.com/forms/templates/call-back-form-template/), for a standalone contact form app.

### Access control

Of course, it’s vital to control the data and features that different portal users can access. Your clients and your internal team have very different needs within your client portal. For instance, it’s crucial that clients’ information can only be accessed by authorized users.

Internal users need to access additional functions, to carry out more complex admin tasks.

Our client portal for accountants template uses two access tiers, providing a clear and secure UI for clients and internal teams alike. Budibase also offers full customization of permissions, allowing you to add additional tiers as and when you need them.

### Dedicated admin panel

We’ve provided a dedicated admin panel within our client portal template. This allows internal teams to view and edit client information, as well as quickly email the client’s nominated point of contact.

Within the admin panel, users can view clients’ document requests and submissions. They can also upload and send documents to clients, quickly and securely.

Naturally, the admin panel is restricted to users with higher levels of access. This section of our portal template allows users to view and edit data relating to all clients. As such, it is restricted to your internal team.
