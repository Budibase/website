Efficient customer service is crucial for modern businesses. Lengthy customer interactions cost money and create negative experiences. This impacts both your profitability and your customer retention rates.

One solution to this problem is empowering customers to manage their own accounts. This eliminates the need for customer interactions regarding common requests and queries. Cut operational costs and free your service agents up to deal with more complex issues.

## What is a customer account portal?

A customer account portal is a closed platform, which allows users to edit their personal details and payment information. The goal is to eliminate the need for customers to contact your team to carry out simple admin tasks.

Beyond this basic functionality, many customer account portals offer additional features, including:

* Order/subscription management,
* Contact forms,
* Exclusive content,
* Personalized deals and offers.

### Why do I need a customer account portal?

Businesses today operate in an increasingly competitive environment. On the one hand, new digital tools make it easier to streamline service workflows. On the other, customer experiences are an increasingly important decision factor.

Customer portals leverage both of these facts, to help your business gain a competitive advantage.

Use our customer account portal template to supercharge your customer experiences. Allow new and existing customers to take control over their accounts, and pick up some exclusive deals along the way.

### What should a customer account portal contain?

The contents of customer account portals vary greatly from business to business. The key thing is to give customers the ability to make changes to any account or transaction details.

Depending on your business, this can include:

* Personal information,
* Payment details,
* Contact preferences,
* Order management,
* Brand interactions,
* And more.

For example, if you sell physical goods to customers, your customer portal should include order management functions. If you sell a service or digital product, customers should be able to manage their payments and subscription options.

## Our customer account portal template

Our customer account portal template is designed to offer a deployable self-service admin tool, in minutes.

Like all Budibase apps, our template offers:

* Customizable design.
* Customer service workflows.
* Automations.
* Intuitive UI.
* Tiered permissions.
* External database support.
* Responsive design.
* Flexible hosting & deployment.
* Third-party integrations.
* Efficient processes.

Use our open-source, low-code customer portal to streamline your admin and customer service processes.

### Self-service customer portals

Our customer account portal template is built to empower customers to manage their details, orders, and service queries. Our simple, intuitive interface allows even users with low digital skills to manage their own admin queries.

Our portal template features four data sets - _Customer Details, Orders, Customer Offers,_ and _Service Queries_. Users can access different screens relating to each of these. Customers can edit their details, track and cancel orders, view personalized offers, and send customer service queries.

Cut admin time by giving your customers an easy-to-use portal, to handle the most common customer service issues.

### Multi-step account forms

We’ve designed an intuitive and simple interface for customers to manage their account details. When customers first access the platform, they’ll be prompted to enter their details. This creates a new record in the customer details database, allowing them to access other functions.

Existing customers can then use the _Edit My Details_ screen to make changes to their accounts.

Here, a multi-step form gives users the option of editing their personal details, payment information, or both. Our template’s [multi-step form](https://budibase.com/forms) interface streamlines the process of changing customer details, improving adoption rates.

### Exclusive content and deals

Besides reducing admin costs, customer account portals are an excellent way to build brand loyalty. One of the most effective ways to do this is by offering exclusive content and deals within your portal.

Our template features a screen for displaying personalized offers to users. Customers can browse your latest deals, and use exclusive coupon codes to reward their loyalty.

With Budibase, you can build relationships between datasets, to tailor offers to individual customers. We’ve also provided a simple admin panel for your team to update and add new offers.

### Contact form

Of course, not every admin query can be handled with a self-service portal. For more complex issues, customers will need to contact your team. For these situations, we’ve created a simple contact form interface.

Customers can simply add the details of their query, along with their preferred contact details. Rather than waiting in a phone queue, the next available service agent can simply contact them.

Under the admin panel, your team can then manage and respond to queries. We’ve provided contact buttons under each query page, allowing your team to contact customers in seconds, using the _mailto_ command.

### Custom functionality

Our template is built to expand and scale. With our open-source, low-code platform, you have complete control over your portal’s features and functionality. Even better, you can add new screens and functions in minutes.

Budibase offers a range of automations, integrations, data connectors, and a built-in JavaScript editor. Our platform gives users the power to create powerful custom portals, in a fraction of the time of traditional development.

Connect your customer account portal to external tools, including CRMs, softphones, inventory management tools, and more.

### Process automation

Automating customer service processes is an effective way to streamline operations and improve customer experiences. Budibase features a wide range of built-in automations, as well as support for third-party tools.

Trigger internal and external automations, from any user action within our customer account portal template.

Use process automations to perfect your customer experiences. Automate everything from communications and relationship management to inventory and logistics management from actions in your customer portal.

### Access control

Naturally, your customers and your internal team will use your account portal differently. Our template features tiered permissions and access control. Maximize security and efficiency, by giving users the exact access they need.

Our template uses two permission tiers, with two additional levels built-in to the Budibase editor. You also have complete control to edit these or add additional permission tiers, based on your needs.

Tiered access allows you to protect users’ data, by limiting who can access different elements of your portal.

### Responsive UI
