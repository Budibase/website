Hiring staff is expensive. Between job boards, recruiters, and internal admin time, hiring a single employee typically costs thousands. In many organizations, this can lead to disruption, delay, and resourcing issues.

With our responsive job portal template, you can take back control of your hiring process. Eliminate the need for expensive recruitment apps, and minimize admin time, with our simple, deployable template.

## What is job portal app development?

Job portal development means creating a private, secure platform for advertising job openings, and sourcing candidates. This can be aimed at either internal or external users. A job portal also allows your team to manage and respond to applications, as they come in.

However, custom job portal app development has historically been an expensive option. Most organizations rely on public job board websites, as custom portal development can cost tens of thousands of dollars.

At Budibase, we’re changing this. With our free, low-code builder, you can build a deployable custom job portal, in minutes.

### Why do I need a job portal?

Job portals are the most cost-effective way for large organizations to find and hire talent. Implementing a job portal is a simple way to eliminate the costs associated with advertising vacancies and attracting talent.

Job portals also greatly reduce the admin burden on your HR team. Centralizing all of your job ads, applications, and candidates is the first step towards automating internal processes. Use our responsive job portal template to streamline your hiring process.

### What should a job portal contain?

All job portals carry out three basic functions:

1. Advertising vacancies,
2. Allowing candidates to submit an application,
3. Giving hiring managers a platform to view and manage applications.

In other words, a job portal operates like a private job board, with added admin functionality. The benefit of custom job portal app development is that you can fully tailor your platform to your hiring processes.

Applicants can view vacancies on the _job search_ screen, or with the _latest jobs_ repeater on the portal’s home screen.

### Multi-step application forms

Our template features a user-friendly, multi-step application form interface. Applicants are guided through the process of adding their personal details, cover letter, and resumé, before reviewing their application.

Application forms are totally customizable, and can even be tailored to specific roles.

With Budibase, creating customized application workflows takes minutes. Simply direct users to bespoke application forms for each vacancy, or use conditionality to display different fields on a single form.

### Customize criteria

With Budibase, you have complete scope to customize your hiring criteria. Our job portal template offers fields for job descriptions, essential criteria, desirable criteria, and benefits. For instance, you might offer more detailed criteria on technical skills or language requirements.

With our job portal app template, how you hire is up to you.

Simply add new columns to the _Job Ads_ database, and you’ll be able to autogenerate new screen designs. Then, all you need to do is tweak the UI and branding of your recruitment portal.

### Secure applicant data

Protecting applicants’ personal data is critical. This means preventing data breaches, leaks, and unauthorized access. Today, security breaches are one of the most prominent risks businesses face.

Budibase empowers users to implement the exact right security standards for their organizations.

Our platform offers a range of advanced security features. These include custom access control, optional self-hosting, and support for a range of authentication standards.

### Manage applications

Reviewing applications is a lengthy and expensive process. For some businesses, this means manually reading and assessing applications. For bulk hiring, you might screen resumés automatically with scoring tools.

With our responsive job portal app template, your team can search and review applications for each active vacancy. We’ve also provided a contact button within each application screen. Team members can contact candidates in seconds with the _mailto:_ command.

Budibase also supports a variety of third-party integrations, using Zapier and Webhooks. Connect to external hiring tools, HR software, and ATS systems to supercharge your job portal’s functionality.

### Automate processes

Trigger Budibase’s library of built-in automations from any action in our job portal template. This allows you to fully tailor your portal’s admin functions to your internal workflows. Budibase also offers a built-in JavaScript editor, for adding complex functions.

Use our integration options to trigger automations in third-party tools, using in-app actions.

Automations allow you to eliminate admin tasks, minimizing your time-to-hire and operating costs.

### Tiered permissions

Controlling access to your app is a key part of job portal development. Our template offers tiered permissions, allowing applicants and internal teams to access different data and functionalities.

_Basic_ users can view and apply for vacancies, while _Power_ users can add new roles, review applications, and contact applicants.

You also have the option to add additional app screens for _Public_ users. This gives you the flexibility to deploy our template as an internal, external, or hybrid job portal.
