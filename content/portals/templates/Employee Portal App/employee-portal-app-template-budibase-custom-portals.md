As your business grows, it becomes more costly and difficult to manage basic human resources tasks. This includes sharing information, managing communications, and staying on top of HR admin.

With the rise of remote working, this problem has become magnified.

Our employee portal template offers a central platform for employees to access, edit, and submit information. Cut admin time and operating costs, by streamlining your internal processes, with a secure, effective employee portal.

## What is an employee portal?

An employee portal is a private app, which allows your team to access internal policies, information, and admin tools. This can include everything from basic internal documents, and staff directories, to more advanced functions.

For example, many employee portals contain or integrate with [digital forms](https://budibase.com/forms), for vacation requests, incident reporting, or other HR functions.

The goal is to empower employees to carry out admin tasks, in the most efficient way possible.

### Why do I need an employee portal?

Almost every organization wastes time and money on avoidable meetings, calls, or paperwork. This greatly hurts your profitability. Portal apps are one of the most effective ways to cut out unnecessary admin tasks.

The need for effective portals is particularly acute in large organizations or remote teams. In these situations, simple admin tasks can be incredibly challenging, especially where employees are unfamiliar with processes, or points of contact.

### What should an employee portal contain?

What you include in your employee portal depends on your organization and your employees’ needs. For example, many companies need their employees to access specialist tools or workflows.

Employee portals usually include the following kinds of resources:

* Processes and policy documents.
* Employee and department details.
* Company announcements and exclusive content.
* HR and admin functionality.

Of course, each of these categories can include a range of different resources. Because of this, employee portals are a powerful tool for streamlining operations. The key thing is that the contents of your portal match your internal processes and workflows.

## Our employee portal app template

Our employee portal app template offers essential functionality, in a quickly deployable package.

Like all Budibase apps, our template offers:

* Fully customizable design.
* Effective internal workflows.
* Automations.
* Intuitive UI.
* Tiered permissions.
* External database support.
* Responsive design.
* Flexible hosting & deployment.
* UX and UI optimizations.
* Efficient processes.

With Budibase, building highly customized and functional business tools is fast and simple.

### Centralize resources

The most basic employee portals are centralized information resources. When your employees need a piece of information, they can simply log into your portal, and access it. This includes key company information, like policies and other documentation.

One of the most common uses for employee portals is to provide staff directories. This is crucial for large, or remote organizations, where employees don’t always know their colleagues.

Even better, our employee portal allows your team to update their own details. Any changes made by employees to their personal information or contact details are then reflected in the built-in directory.

### Streamline communications

Employee portal apps are an effective way to streamline internal communications and cut operational costs. An employee portal can be used to automate just about any internal admin or HR task.

Our template offers functionality for distributing company announcements to all colleagues. Users can view embedded previews on the app’s home screen, or search for content on the announcements page.

Budibase also offers full support for email automations. Add your SMTP credentials to trigger email notifications from any in-app action. Employees can also send emails to colleagues directly from the built-in directory, using the _mailto:_ command.

### Reduce admin time

Admin tasks are a massive drain on companies’ resources. HR is one of the most admin-intensive verticals in any organization. Our portal empowers employees to complete simple admin tasks quickly and easily.

Our template allows employees to alter their contact information, personal details, or payroll data, in seconds. Using a simple form interface, your team can submit changes to their details, without the need to contact the HR department.

At Budibase, we’re building the world’s largest ecosystem of business tools. Our employee portal app can be expanded, using any of our other digital form templates. Add capability by integrating with vacation request, equipment checkout, employee onboarding, or COVID tracking forms.

### Custom functionality

Our employee portal template is built for complete customization. Our template app features four key screens. These are _company announcements, an employee directory, internal resources,_ and an _admin panel_ for managing these.

All data fields and workflows within these built-in functions are fully customizable. Tweak and adjust your app to match your company’s needs.

Budibase also offers full scope for adding additional functions. In minutes, you can add new screens, data sources, and automations. Easily create additional screens and interfaces to provide new functions to users.

### Process automation

Employee portals are the perfect platforms for automating internal processes. The goal of any internal portal is to empower employees to carry out their own admin tasks. Automation makes this a reality.

With Budibase, you can trigger a wide range of automations, from any in-app action. For instance, you could notify finance teams when an employee submits new payment details. Use our built-in JavaScript editor to add additional functionality to your app.

Budibase also supports a variety of third-party [integrations,](https://budibase.com/integration) using Zapier and Webhooks. Connect your employee portal to messaging apps, calendars, HR software, or other external tools, to trigger external automations.

### Access control

Of course, it’s crucial to control how users access your employee portal app. Budibase offers customizable user permissions. For instance, some of your team need higher levels of access to carry out admin functions.

This also protects your employees’ data from unauthorized access.

All Budibase tools come with four permission tiers, as standard. With our open-source, low-code builder, you have complete control to edit, remove, or add new permission tiers.
