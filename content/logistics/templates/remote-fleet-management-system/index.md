In the logistics industry, your vehicles are your most valuable asset. Our template ensures that they deliver maximum value.

Running and maintaining a fleet of vehicles incurs a wide variety of different costs. On the one hand, you have day-to-day costs, like fuel, driver’s wages, taxes, insurance preventative maintenance, and servicing.

Then there’s vehicle purchasing, depreciation, and unforeseen repairs.

If not accounted for properly, any of these costs can destroy your fleet’s profitability. This is where fleet management comes in. Use our template to manage fleets remotely, ensuring maximum ROI across all of your vehicles.

## What is remote fleet management?

Fleet management is all about collecting, tracking, and analyzing data on your vehicle utilization. That is, how vehicles are deployed, used, and maintained. Remote fleet management allows you to do this, no matter where your vehicles or drivers are located.

In other words, drivers can record vehicle data utilization in the field. This data can then be analyzed and managed from head office.

The goal is to collect as much data as possible on vehicle utilization. This is used to ensure your fleet is deployed as efficiently and profitably as possible.

### Why do you need fleet management software?

In the logistics industry, profit margins are paper-thin. Even minor efficiencies can mean losing your competitive edge. Fleet management software takes the guesswork out of maintaining profitability.

Identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement in your vehicle utilization.

An effective fleet management platform also allows you to streamline workflows. Reduce operating costs by automating manual admin tasks. Create a centralized platform that minimizes the admin burden on your operations team.

### What should a remote fleet management system contain?

At a basic level, a fleet management system comprises of two elements:

1. A database for storing vehicle utilization information.
2. A front-end interface for collecting, managing, and analyzing data.

This includes vehicle details, utilization information, and maintenance needs, across your entire fleet. The goal is to centralize data while giving your ground staff an intuitive way to log key usage and maintenance details.

More advanced solutions also offer features for optimizing fleet management workflows. Third-party integrations, custom automation rules, and data visualization can all be used to maximize ROI across your fleet.

## Our fleet management template

We’ve built our template to maximize oversight, usability, and profitability. Manage vehicle usage, maintenance, and costs, from a single intuitive platform.

Our remote fleet management system offers:

* Design customization.
* Data visualization.
* Automated workflows.
* Intuitive UI.
* Custom RBAC.
* External database connectors.
* Responsive design.
* Optional self-hosting.
* Third-party app integrations.
* Efficient and cost-effective processes.
* Custom data fields.

Use our template as a fully deployable solution, or tweak and customize it to your specific requirements.

### Centralized fleet management

Our fleet management solution is built around three related databases, for _vehicles, driver check-ins_, and _maintenance_. When a user records a journey or a maintenance session, relevant details are updated for the vehicle.

Use our simple interfaces to create highly automated vehicle utilization datasets.

We’ve provided a range of screens for adding, editing, and analyzing entries across all three built-in databases. Use our dynamic filtering components to quickly find the exact data you need at any moment.

### Automated cost controls and fuel management

We’ve provided extensive functionality for calculating vehicles costs, based on simple user inputs. Drivers can simply record their daily mileage and fuel expenses. Our template automatically calculates lifetime averages for fuel consumption, cost-per-mile, and more.

Use handlebars expressions, filter views, or our built-in JavaScript editor to create your own custom cost calculations.

Add additional variables or weighting rules to align our template with your specific fleet operations.

### Data visualization

Our fleet management system features a dedicated analytics screen. Quickly analyze trends in mileage, fuel consumption operating costs, vehicle status, and more. Use any combination of expressions and variables to sort and filter visualized data.

With Budibase, it’s easy to create highly detailed charts and graphs for all kinds of data.

Use our template to analyze fleet-wide trends or granular data, and identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities alike.

### Maintenance scheduling

Use our template to manage maintenance schedules. Each vehicle entry is given a monthly service interval. When a maintenance checklist is completed, the next service date is automatically updated.

Say goodbye to manually tracking your fleet’s preventative maintenance scheduling.

Our maintenance scheduling functionality is fully customizable. Quickly set fixed service dates, or create mileage-based calculations. Connect to calendar apps, communications tools, and more for fully streamlined fleet maintenance workflows.

### Multi-step forms & conditionality

Our template offers unrivaled usability. We’ve created intuitive [multi-step forms](https://budibase.com/forms) for registering journeys and vehicle maintenance. Ensure maximum adoption and accuracy by giving your team a tool they’ll love to use.

Budibase offers powerful conditional UIs. Hide, display, or update and design elements based on user inputs, behavior, form data, automation rules, and more.

It’s crucial for remote fleet management systems to work seamlessly on all devices. With multi-step forms and conditional UIs, Budibase is the smart way to build incredible mobile user experiences.

### Role-based access control

Choose Budibase for fully customizable role-based access control. Assign different permission tiers to users, based on their seniority, job role, location, department, or other attributes.

We’ve built our template around three levels of access. _Basic_ users can access and manage _vehicle_ data and create _check-ins_. _Power_ users have access to _maintenance_ screens and data. _Admins_ can access and use our analytics screens.

With custom RBAC from Budibase, you can provide users with the exact data and functionality they need.
