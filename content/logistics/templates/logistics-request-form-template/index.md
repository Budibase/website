Give customers an intuitive, automated tool for requesting and costing shipments, transportation, and stock movement.

Logistics companies deal with a wide variety of requests. For many companies, this means managing huge amounts of emails, phone calls, and other communications.

Cut operating costs and reduce admin burdens with our streamlined request management tool.

## What is a logistics request form?

Request forms are dedicated tools for managing user queries. For logistics companies, this typically means allowing users to provide key details of their requirements. For example, item details, point of origin, destination, turnaround time, and any special considerations.

By collecting this data in a fixed format, you can automate admin tasks, providing smoother and more cost-effective customer experiences.

The goal is to maximize your competitiveness and profitability, by ensuring that your initiation workflows are as efficient as possible.

### Why digitize logistics requests?

Margins in the logistics industry are paper-thin. This means that even minor inefficiencies can undermine your profitability. For modern logistics companies, digital transformation is the key to maintaining competitiveness.

Digitalization enables you to take a data-led approach to logistics. Fast and effective decision-making is crucial. Accurate and consistent data collection empowers you to make better decisions.

Digital logistics requests also enable you to automate workflows. Give your users an intuitive tool to collect accurate data, in a consistent format. This is crucial for automating admin tasks, communications, cost-controls, estimation, and more.

### What should a logistics request tool contain?

Request form tools have two key elements:

1. A data layer for storing, organizing, and managing request data.
2. A front-end interface for submitting, responding to, and actioning requests.

For logistics companies, this means giving clients a clear form for requesting transportation, stock movement, and other services. That way, you can eliminate the need for manual inquiries via phone or email.

Of course, the most effective solutions also provide functionality for responding to requests. For instance, automated estimations, communications features, project initiation workflows, third-party app support, and more.
