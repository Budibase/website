#### What is operations software?
Operations software is used to plan, manage, streamline, and coordinate different kinds of business workflows. This might mean the daily tasks of individual team members, departmental processes, or the business as a whole. These days, almost every department and business vertical includes an operations management function. Digitalization aims to reduce costs, minimize risk, cut admin time, improve oversight, and deliver more effective workflows.

#### Why build a custom solution?
Many businesses use off-the-shelf tools for managing operations. These often lack specific features, carry excessive costs, or make it difficult to properly map internal workflows. Custom tools are used to fill gaps in off-the-shelf solutions or replace them entirely. Every business is unique. This means that the most effective operations tools vary from business to business.
