Managing properties is a challenge. Properly maintaining facilities requires high levels of organization. When done manually, this can lead to large volumes of admin work.

Operations teams need high levels of oversight over how facilities are managed. Otherwise, it’s almost impossible to achieve profitability or provide positive client experiences. 

## What is a facility management app?

Facility management tools simplify your workflows. By digitizing your maintenance workflows, you can automate most elements of your facilities management. This reduces costs, while also improving outcomes.

In other words, facilities management apps are used to replace manual admin processes.

This means empowering your team to use a more systematic approach to facilities management. Ultimately, the goal is to improve processes and outcomes, while reducing costs.

### Why digitize facility management?

Digitizing facilities management ensures that your workflows are as efficient and cost-effective as possible. This means:

* Automating key administrative tasks.
* Providing streamlined interfaces for maintenance staff.

There’s no getting around the fact that managing properties is expensive. Some of these costs, such as materials, labor, and transportation are inevitable. Other costs can be largely avoided. These mainly stem from excessive admin time, and human error.

Digital tools help to eliminate both of these. By automating manual admin tasks, you can create streamlined processes, massively reducing administrative costs.

### What should facility management software include?

A basic facility management tool has three components.

1. A database for storing facilities information and maintenance rules.
2. Interfaces for managing workflows.
3. Digital checklists for creating maintenance tasks.

In other words, software enables you to define, manage, and execute maintenance workflows. The goal is to create efficient and cost-effective internal processes.

The best digital tools offer additional features for communications, organization, and asset management. For example, automating emails, work order management, and stock movement.

## Our facility management template

Our free facility management app is feature-rich and ready to deploy. With minimal technical skills, you can use our template to create your perfect custom tool, in minutes.

Like all Budibase apps, this template offers:

* Design customization.
* Data visualization.
* Automated workflows.
* Intuitive UI.
* Custom permissions.
* External database connectors.
* Responsive design.
* Optional self-hosting.
* Third-party app integrations.
* Efficient and cost-effective processes.
* Custom data fields.

Budibase is the smart way to build custom operations tools.

### Track and manage maintenance tasks

Our template is built to supercharge workflow management. We’ve built our tool around a central facilities database for storing key maintenance information across multiple sites. Set maintenance intervals, and register each new service session, in seconds.

We’ve added custom rules to calculate the next maintenance date for each entry, based on its individual service interval.

Reduce admin burdens by using a tool that automatically calculates and schedules preventative maintenance. Our template is the fast and flexible way to digitize your facility management workflows.

### Digital maintenance checklists

Give your team a streamlined tool for carrying out maintenance work. We’ve provided intuitive, digital checklists for completing maintenance tasks. Improve oversight of all facilities management work, while also providing better agent experiences.

We’ve used a slick, multi-step form interface for all maintenance checklists. Each time a form is completed, a new row is created on our _checklists_ database. At the same time, the maintenance date and status are updated for the relevant _facilities_ entry.

Our maintenance checklists are fully customizable. Add, remove, or alter any field. You can also create bespoke checklists for each room category, or individual facility.

### Real-time facility management calendar

On the app’s home screen, we’ve provided a real-time calendar for pending maintenance tasks. All tasks which are scheduled for the next current day are automatically populated. For a smooth user experience, these link directly to the relevant maintenance checklist.

We’ve also provided a simple filtering tool for multi-site management. Use our dropdown menu to filter your facility management calendar by specific locations.

Our calendar is fully customizable. Configure your own date ranges, filtering options, and access control, to perfectly suit your internal processes.

### Mobile-friendly design

Give your team a tool that works seamlessly in the field or at head office. Like all Budibase tools, our facility management app is fully mobile responsive. All design elements automatically scale, to fit perfectly on any screen.

Any app is only as good as how it’s used. Ensure maximum app adoption, by giving your team a tool they’ll love to use.

Using Budibase’s conditional UIs and [multi-step forms](https://budibase.com/forms), you can quickly and easily create fully mobile-optimized user experiences.

### Store and manage facilities data

Our template is built for maximum oversight of facility management workflows. Our _facilities_ and _checklists_ database create a clear record of all maintenance tasks. Monitor trends in terms of individual service agents, facilities, and task lists.

We’ve also provided a series of screens for updating and managing app data.

Quickly search for individual records, or add, edit, and delete entries. Our template is the perfect way to manage facilities data, without the need for advanced database skills.

### Tiered permissions

Take control over how different users interact with your facilities management software. In Budibase, you can quickly and easily create custom access control rules. Grant access to screens and data, based on department, seniority, roles, and more.

We’ve built our app around two permission tiers. _Basic_ users can view facility details and log maintenance sessions. _Power_ users can then view and review all maintenance logs.

Maintain maximum app security, while providing the smoothest possible experience for individual users.

### Searchability and filtering

We’ve provided searchability and filtering tools throughout our template. Use our intuitive interfaces to quickly locate and call the exact data you need. Budibase is the easy way to manage complex workflows.

Both of our built-in datasets have dedicated listing screens.

Use our _dynamic filter_ components to quickly search for any _facilities_ or _checklists_ entry, based on any data field. With Budibase, you can also quickly add search fields for any field, using simple form interfaces.
