Maintaining equipment, properties, and fleets is expensive. Between managing workloads, and retaining profitability, maintenance teams face massive challenges. These become more difficult, the larger your organization is.

However, poor asset management is more expensive in the long run. Work order software helps to cut costs by reducing maintenance bills, service interruptions, and risks of accidents and incidents.

## What is a work order app?

Work order software allows users to request maintenance, servicing, or repairs, at the click of a button. This might be your internal team, customers, or members of the public. You can then manage, respond to, and assign these requests.

In turn, this provides better oversight for maintenance managers. When you collect maintenance data in a single location, you can analyze trends in costs, completion times, and service agent performance.

Work order apps also create a clear paper trail of all maintenance activities. This is crucial for responding to queries, complaints, and questions.

### Why digitize work orders?

Digitizing work requests reduces costs, improves outcomes, and increases operational efficiency. Even today, many businesses manage work orders using phone calls, emails, or even pen and paper.

Naturally, this isn’t ideal. Manually managing work orders involves excessive admin time and costs. Using work order software is an effective way to eliminate unnecessary maintenance costs.

This enables maintenance teams to provide a higher quality of service, at a fraction of the cost.

### What should a work order tool include?

Work order tools essentially perform three functions. These are:

* Allowing users to make work order requests.
* Managing and assigning tasks.
* Tracking and monitoring service data.

This ensures that work order processes are as efficient as possible. At the press of a button, users can request, assign, and action maintenance tasks. Your team can then analyze their costs, in terms of time and money.

Beyond this, the most effective work order tools include extra features to maximize efficiency. This includes communication, admin, record-keeping, and other functionalities.

### Assign, track, and manage work orders

Our template simplifies work order administration. Users can submit instant maintenance requests, with a simple form interface. Your team can then assess, assign, and action all requests.

Once a task is assigned, the service agent completes a second form, detailing the costs, actions, and time incurred. This creates a clear paper trail for all work orders. Work orders can then be analyzed and compared in terms of costs, completion times, and more.

We’ve created a single platform for managing servicing workflows, from initial request to completion. Use our template to centralize work order functionality, data, and processes.

### Custom work order forms

### Categorization and taxonomies

Our template is built for work order categorization. When submitting a work request, users are asked to choose a category for their maintenance needs. Categories include preventative maintenance and emergency repairs. Your internal team must then assign an agent before work can be completed.

We’ve provided dynamic filters throughout our free work order app. Sort, filter, and locate different records based on any category or taxonomy.

A variety of data fields can also be used to filter work order records for analysis. View the costs and time logs of each individual service agent to identify improvement opportunities for your team.

### Real-time analysis and visualization

Monitor your maintenance team’s performance on our template’s analytics dashboard. When recording completed work, agents are asked to note the hours they used and any material costs.

Our template uses a set formula to calculate labor costs, based on the hours used. This is can be customized for each individual service agent, offering accurate, automated calculations.

Use our analytics dashboard to review completion times and labor, materials, and overall costs for all service agents. We’ve also added a carousel on the analytics screen, displaying all assigned tasks for each agent.

Our workflow app is ready to be used in the field. Like all Budibase tools, our template is fully mobile-responsive. All screens scale and resize to fit perfectly on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.

### Tiered permissions

Budibase offers fully customizable access control. We’ve built our template around two permission tiers, for maintenance teams and service users. Users with lower permissions can submit work orders, and view the status of their own requests.

Power users are then able to assess, assign, and action all work orders, as well as analyze outcomes.

Ensure maximum security and usability in your app, by providing users with access to the exact features and data they need.
