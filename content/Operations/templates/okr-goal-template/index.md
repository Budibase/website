We’ve created a dedicated app for creating, managing, and achieving OKRs.

Setting goals and analyzing performance are crucial in any business. However, some goals are more effective than others. These days, OKRs are one of the most popular options, across all kinds of industries.

How you set goals has a concrete impact on your business’ performance. Choosing the right methodology for tracking goals is crucial. The goal is to set goals that can effectively be analyzed, tracked, and achieved. 

## What are OKRs?

OKR stands for _objectives and key results_. The idea is to break your goals down into two parts:

1. **Objectives -** What you want to achieve.
2. **Key Results -** The specific ways you’re going to meet your goals, and metrics to track your progress.

In other words, your objective is your overarching goal. Key results are a way of breaking this down into more specific and manageable targets.

OKRs first emerged in the tech space. Today, they’re a popular framework among all kinds of businesses, organizations, and individuals alike.

### Why digitize OKR tracking?

There are many different ways to track OKRs. Many businesses simply use pen and paper. Others may use spreadsheets. However, neither of these methods is totally effective. These manual methods create unnecessary admin work and scope for human error.

Digital platforms offer supercharged OKR tracking.

Digitization empowers you to automate and streamline workflows. Rather than manually tracking your progress, our OKR goal template automatically updates and manages your goals, based on user actions and time-specific rules.

The goal is to save time and money, while also making it easier for you to achieve your goals.

### What should an OKR tracking app include?

A basic OKR tracking app has two key features:

* An interface for creating and defining new objectives and key results.
* A system for tracking, managing, and working towards these goals.

This replaces manual tracking methods and centralizes all data around your goals. Ultimately, this means reducing the admin burden required to manage your business goals.

The most effective OKR tools also automate key processes. For instance, they might notify users when key milestones are upcoming or the status of one of your goal changes. Naturally, this requires customization to match your existing business rules and processes.

## Our OKR goal template

Our OKR goal template is built to embed the OKR methodology in your organization. With full customization and intuitive design, our template is the most effective way to start implementing OKR to achieve your goals.

Our template offers:

* Design customization.
* Process automation.
* Intuitive UI.
* Tiered access.
* Third-party integrations.
* Responsive design.

### Create specific objectives and key results

Our template is built around intuitive screens for setting OKRs. We’ve provided separate, linked, forms for setting both high-level objectives and more specific key results. Our simple forms empower you to create new OKRs, in seconds.

When you complete either form, a new row is created in the respective database. Quickly build relationships between objectives and key results, without the need for specific database management knowledge.

With Budibase, you can customize your form fields to match your unique workflows. Add, edit, or remove any data field, with no need for special technical skills.

The right OKR tool will empower you to achieve your goals. We’ve provided a suite of features for tracking, managing, and meeting OKRs. Use our searchable goal management screens to quickly find, edit, and update your goals.

Each objective and key result has a unique detail screen. We’ve used an intuitive UI and multi-step form to create a smooth user experience for viewing, editing, and managing your specific OKRs.

Use our dynamic filter components to easily sort, find, and filter entries. Use simple _equals_ expressions, or mathematical formulae to set conditions to filter different entries on your OKR app’s front-end.

### Process automation

### Customize access control

Budibase offers fully customizable permission tiers. Control who can access different screens, data, functions, and more. Provide the best possible user experience, while also ensuring maximum app security.

Like all Budibase tools, our template features four permission tiers as standards. Use a simple drop-down bar in the Budibase builder to assign each screen to your desired user tier.

Add, alter, or remove each of these tiers, to perfectly suit your needs. With Budibase, you have complete control over how your app is accessed and used.

Real-time notifications in Budibase help to improve oversight, and project outcomes. Instantly view whether or not you’re on track to meet your most urgent goals.

Use our range of third-party app integrations and built-in automations to manage communications within your OKR tool. Add SMTP credentials to send automated emails, based on your own custom rules.
