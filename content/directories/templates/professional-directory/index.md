For business groups, professional bodies, and industry associations, providing fast access to accurate information is critical. Managing this can lead to huge costs. This includes admin work, human error, miscommunications, and avoidable risk.

Our template is designed to minimize risk, simplify administration, and maximize cost-effectiveness.

## What is a professional directory?

Professional directories store information on companies that are signed up to a specific organization. This data is then accessible internally, by members, or by members of the public.

The goal is to ensure that users have fast access to up-to-date, accurate information. Of course, this also requires certain users to be able to update existing entries or add entirely new data.

Typically, directories store basic business information, including contact details, locations, and descriptions of products or services.

### Why manage directory listings with a custom tool?

Many organizations build directories without dedicated tools. Some rely on spreadsheets. Others use off-the-shelf tools, including CRMs, custom web pages, WordPress plug-ins, or other non-specific apps.

None of these solutions are ideal. Relying on spreadsheets to build and manage directories creates massive inefficiencies, scope for error, and security risks. Other non-dedicated solutions can provide a confusing user experience, or lack specific functionalities.

Dedicated tools offer superior functionality, usability, and security. Build an intuitive tool to give your users the data they need, right at their fingertips.

### What should a directory app include?

Directories are simple [CRUD apps](https://budibase.com/blog/crud-app/), that allow users to _create_, _read_, _update_, or _delete_ data. Like all CRUD tools, they’re built around two elements:

1. A back-end layer for storing data.
2. A front-end interface for performing CRUD actions.

Users can add, access, and update any entries in the app’s back-end, without the need for specific database skills.

More advanced directories provide additional functionality for streamlining data management tasks. These include third-party integrations, role-based access control, custom automations, and more.

## Our professional directory template

Our app is built around two screens. All users can search and view directory entries from the app’s primary screen. We’ve also added provided an _admin_ screen, where internal users can add or update data.

All app actions can be performed using simple modal pop-out screens.

### Instant CRUD actions

Ensure maximum accuracy by giving your users a tool to manage and manipulate data, in seconds.

Budibase tools are the easy, quick way to maintain even the most complex of directories.

### Searchability and filtering

Our template offers advanced search and filtering functionality. Our app’s home screen features drop-down selectors for directory categories and members’ locations, as well as a text field for searching entries by company name.

We’ve also added a _dynamic filter_ component to our admin screen. Search for directory entries based on any field or variable. Use any combination of numerical or textual expressions to filter data.

Maximize efficiency, by giving your users instant access to the exact information they need.

### Custom data fields

Our app’s data layer is fully customizable. Add, edit, or remove fields in the back-end, and autogenerate updated screens and forms. Budibase offers a huge range of data types, including text fields, numbers, attachments, relationships, formulas, and more.

Create complex formula variables, using JavaScript, Handlebars expressions, and relational data.

Use bindable data throughout our app, including in tables, Markdown viewer UIs, and card components to create truly stunning user interfaces.

### Multi-step forms

With multiple form steps, modal screens, and conditional UIs, users can add new directory entries in seconds.

### Mobile-friendly design

Our professional directory template works perfectly on all devices. Our app components instantly scale to fit on phones, desktops, and tablets. Empower your users with a directory tool that they can take with them, wherever they go.

Budibase components are also thoroughly accessibility tested.

Use custom conditionality rules to display modified interfaces to mobile users. Consolidate information, remove elements, or truncate screens, depending on what type of device your app is viewed from.

### Custom RBAC

Budibase offers customizable role-based access control. Grant each user the exact permissions they need, to maximize security and usability. Restrict whole screens at the press of a button, or hide specific components with custom conditionality rules.

Our template is built around two levels of access. _Public_ users can search and view the details of any company in the directory.

_Admin_ users can access a special additional screen to edit existing entries or add new companies’ details.
