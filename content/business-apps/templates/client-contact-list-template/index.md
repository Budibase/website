Give your team a fast, intuitive way to record, search, and leverage customer contact information.

Creating a centralized record of your clients is critical for just about every business function. Colleagues from sales, marketing, engineering, support, finance, or any other department may need to get in touch with clients quickly.

Use our contact list app to streamline information gathering, sharing, and client communications.

## What is a contact list tool?

Contact list apps are used to simplify and centralize your client information. These lightweight tools allow your team to quickly add, edit, search and use clients’ contact details. The goal is to make communications workflows as smooth and efficient as possible.

Many businesses have no systematic way of managing their clients’ contact information. Instead, they rely on individual colleagues’ contact lists or phonebooks. This can work fine for managing daily tasks, but problems arise when something unexpected happens.

For example, an employee might leave, go off sick, or even lose their personal contact list. In an emergency, someone might need to contact a client, without knowing which colleague to ask for their information.

Centralization improves efficiency, oversight, and reliability across all kinds of client management workflows.

### Why use a dedicated contact list app?

Of course, many businesses already use spreadsheets, CRMs, or other tools to store client information. This creates its own set of problems. Spreadsheets will quickly lead to disorganized, dated, or lost data.

While CRMs provide extensive functionality, this creates a poor user experience for colleagues who simply want to look up a phone number or email address. Granting company-wide CRM access can also lead to critical data being leaked, corrupted, or deleted by mistake.

Give your team a dedicated tool that combines the benefits of data centralization with smooth, intuitive user experiences.

### What should a client contact tool contain?

Client contact list tools are simple [CRUD apps](https://budibase.com/blog/crud-app/), that are built around two elements:

1. A data layer for storing contact details.
2. A front-end interface for searching, viewing, editing, and recording information.

The idea is to ensure that all colleagues can quickly look up the information they need, or add new client details in a consistent format. This also enables you to leverage client data to automate communications and other workflows.

The most effective contact list apps offer additional functionality to streamline processes. For example, custom automation rules, third-party integrations, role-based access control, and more.
