Create a reliable record of when each employee enters and leaves different sites, in seconds.

This data can then be used for facility planning, payroll automation, office scheduling, and more. Use our template to improve oversight, cut operating costs, and optimize employee experiences.

## What is an employee check-in/check-out app?

As the name suggests, check-in/check-out apps are used to register when employees enter or leave different locations. Users can simply select their office location and check-in or out at the click of a button. Our app uses context to determine if the user is checking in or out, as well as recording their details without requiring any manual inputs.

The goal is to ensure that data is consistent, accurate, and accessible for your leadership team. This also enables you to leverage your check-in/out data across other tools through third-party integrations.

For example, employee check-in data might be used alongside project management tools, payroll software, scheduling apps, and more.

### Why digitize employee check-ins?

Many businesses still manage employee check-ins using pen and paper. Others have no systematic time management practices in place at all. This creates unnecessary administrative work, undermining your operational efficiency.

Beyond this, manually managing employee check-ins creates excessive disorganization and scope for human error.

Digitalization eliminates these problems. An effective check-in/check-out system streamlines a wide range of billing, HR, project management, and operations workflows.

### What should a check-in/check-out app contain?

Employee check-in apps are based on two elements:

1. **A front-end** interface for checking in and out.
2. **A back-end data layer** for storing, organizing, and managing entries.

When an employee checks in or out, a record is created in the database. Our template uses simple relationships to link three database tables for *locations*, _employees_ and _check-ins_/_outs_. When a new check-in or out is created, the relevant employee details are also updated.

The most effective check-in/check-out systems for employees offer additional features for streamlining workflows, including external data support, third-party integrations, and custom process automation.

### Intuitive clock-in/out processes

Our template is built to fully streamline the check-in/check-out process. Say goodbye to time-consuming manual clock-ins. With our simple app, employees can register entrances and exits, in seconds.

We’ve built our app around two distinct user roles. `Employees` can view all company locations and check-in or out of them. `Managers` can view all employees, manage locations, and view the check-in/out history across both.

This gives complete visibility over which employees have visited different sites and when.

### One-click check-ins

We’ve set our check-in/check-out form to auto-populate a new database entry at the click of a button. We've created an automation rule that determines whether a user would need to check-in or out of the selected location, and automatically records their details.

Minimize the input needed from employees to maximize accuracy, efficiency, and process adherence.

### Responsive design

Like all Budibase tools, our employee check-in/check-out template works seamlessly across all devices. Design elements automatically scale and resize to fit perfectly on all kinds of screens.

Our app components are also fully tested for key accessibility standards.

### Custom automations

Our check-in/check-out app is the perfect platform for automating all kinds of workflows. 

Use any in-app action to trigger Budibase’s vast library of built-in automations. Data gathered in our app can be used to feed automations for employee communications, facility management, maintenance scheduling, resourcing, and more.

With Budibase, it’s easy to build powerful custom automation rules. Use JavaScript, handlebars expressions, third-party integrations, and formula variables to create fully custom automation rules, in seconds.

### Conditional UIs

Use our conditional UIs to create fully optimized user experiences. Hide, display, or update any design element, based on form inputs, user data, behavior, employee details, and more.

We’ve used simple conditionality rules to make workflows as efficient as possible, and tailor user experiences.

With our simple conditionality editor, you can set conditions to truncate forms, auto-populate data, or display different data fields, based on any user attribute.

### Design customization

Our template is completely customizable. Use our simple design tools to fully tailor our check-in/out app to your own branding, user journey, and design standards. Use our design themes to quickly perfect your app.

### Custom RBAC

Budibase offers fully customizable, visual role-based access control. Assign permissions to different user groups, based on their department, job role, seniority, location, or any other attribute. Restrict different screens to certain user classes, with our simple visual editor.

Our template utilizes two custom roles, giving you complete scope to tailor your app to your specific security and usability needs.

Ensure maximum app adoption and privacy, by giving each user access to the exact data and features they need.
