Create a reliable record of when each employee enters and leaves different sites, in seconds.

This data can then be used for facility planning, payroll automation, office scheduling, and more. Use our template to improve oversight, cut operating costs, and optimize employee experiences.

## What is an employee check-in/check-out app?

As the name suggests, check-in/check-out apps are used to register when employees enter or leave different locations. Employees can use a simple [form interface](https://budibase.com/forms) to log their location, time of entry, time of departure, and any other relevant details.

The goal is to ensure that data is consistent, accurate, and accessible for your leadership team. This also enables you to leverage your check-in/out data across other tools through third-party integrations.

For example, employee check-in data might be used in project management tools, payroll software, scheduling apps, and more.

### Why digitize employee check-ins?

Many businesses still manage employee check-ins using pen and paper. Others have no systematic time management practices in place at all. This creates unnecessary administrative work, undermining your operational efficiency.

Beyond this, manually managing employee check-ins creates excessive disorganization and scope for human error.

Digitalization eliminates these problems. An effective check-in/check-out system streamlines a wide range of billing, HR, project management, and operations workflows.

### What should a check-in/check-out app contain?

Employee check-in apps are based on two elements:

1. **A front-end** interface for checking in and out.
2. **A back-end data layer** for storing, organizing, and managing entries.

When an employee checks in or out, a record is created in the database. Our template uses simple relationships to link two databases for _employees_ and _check-ins_/_outs_. When a new check-in or out is created, the relevant employee details are also updated.

The most effective check-in/check-out systems for employees offer additional features for streamlining workflows, including external data support, third-party integrations, and custom process automation.

### Intuitive clock-in/out processes

Our template is built to fully streamline the check-in/check-out process. Say goodbye to time-consuming manual clock-ins. With our simple app, employees can register entrances and exits, in seconds.

We’ve built our app around a simple, single-screen interface. Users can select their name, and add their location and time of arrival or departure in a concise modal form.

Our template also tracks which employees are currently at different sites, giving clear oversight of your workforce at all times.

### Auto-populated forms

We’ve set our check-in/check-out form to auto-populate with key employee data. Personal details, locations, and whether an employee is checking in or out are all automatically populated in our forms.

Minimize the input needed from employees to maximize accuracy, efficiency, and process adherence.

All auto-populated data can also be overridden. This ensures that employees can quickly manage fringe cases, or correct data if they’ve forgotten to check in or out on a given day.

### Responsive design

Like all Budibase tools, our employee check-in/check-out template works seamlessly across all devices. Design elements automatically scale and resize to fit perfectly on all kinds of screens.

Our app components are also fully tested for key accessibility standards.

Ensure maximum app adoption by giving your employees a tool they can use anywhere, on any device.

### Custom automations

Our check-in/check-out app is the perfect platform for automating all kinds of workflows. We’ve provided formula variables to automatically update employee details based on their form completions.

Use any in-app action to trigger Budibase’s vast library of built-in automations. Data gathered in our app can be used to feed automations for employee communications, facility management, maintenance scheduling, resourcing, and more.

With Budibase, it’s easy to build powerful custom automation rules. Use JavaScript, handlebars expressions, third-party integrations, and formula variables to create fully custom automation rules, in seconds.

### Conditional UIs

Use our conditional UIs to create fully optimized user experiences. Hide, display, or update any design element, based on form inputs, user data, behavior, employee details, and more.

We’ve used simple conditionality rules to make workflows as efficient as possible, and tailor user experiences.

With our simple conditionality editor, you can set conditions to truncate forms, auto-populate data, or display different data fields, based on any user attribute.

### Design customization

Our template is completely customizable. Use our simple design tools to fully tailor our check-in/out app to your own branding, user journey, and design standards. Use our design themes to quickly perfect your app.

With Budibase, you can build professional custom apps, in under five minutes. We offer autogenerated screens, intuitive design tools, conditionality rules, custom CSS editors, and more.

We’ve provided four permission tiers, giving you complete scope to tailor your app to your specific security and usability needs.

Ensure maximum app adoption and privacy, by giving each user access to the exact data and features they need.
