## What is a complaint record app?

As the name suggests, a complaint record app allows users to log feedback, incidents, and grievances. This can be used either by your customer support team or by customers themselves.

The goal is to ensure that information is recorded accurately and consistently. Complaints record tools maximize efficiency when logging, searching, or viewing submitted data.

This ensures a robust paper trail of all complaint logs. It also creates a dataset that can be leveraged to automate and optimize related workflows.

### Why use a dedicated complaint register?

Many businesses have no systematic way to log customer complaints. Others use spreadsheets, CRMs, or other tools to manage complaints. Each of these options creates avoidable problems.

Naturally, when you don’t have a central register of complaints, it’s almost impossible to learn lessons from unsatisfied customers.

While spreadsheets or CRMs go some way to solving this, they come along with their own difficulties. Managing data with spreadsheets quickly leads to disorganization, human error, and preventable risk.

CRMs lead to poor experiences for internal users who simply want to log a complaint. Using a CRM also prevents customers from logging complaints directly.

Dedicated complaints record tools provide maximum efficiency, centralization, and usability.

### What should a complaints record tool contain?

Complaints record tools are simple [CRUD apps](https://budibase.com/blog/crud-app/), built around two elements:

1. A data layer, for storing complaint information.
2. A front-end interface, for creating, searching, viewing, and altering records.

In other words, users can create, access, update, or delete database entries, using the app’s front-end. The idea is to empower users to create or leverage data, without needing specialized technical skills.

The most effective complaints record tools offer additional functionality for streamlining and optimizing workflows. For example, third-party integrations, formula-based taxonomies, and custom automation rules.
