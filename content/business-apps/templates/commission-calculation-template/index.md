Commission schemes are one of the most popular ways to boost morale and motivation. However, managing this can also create a huge admin burden. Different employees perform differently and can qualify for commission based on a number of complex rules.

Use our template as an intuitive, customizable tool to register sales and calculate the commission owed to each of your employees.

## What is a commission calculator?

As the name suggests, sales commission calculators are simple CRUD applications, that calculate the amount of commission that is owed to your employees. This means setting rules so that when a team member completes a sale, their commission is determined automatically.

The goal is to automate and streamline workflows for issuing commission-based payments.

Define your own rules to match your existing commission structure. That way, your employees can simply log their sales, and our template will take care of the rest.

### Why use a dedicated tool to calculate commissions?

Businesses use a range of tools to manage commission payments. For example, it’s still common for sales managers to manually figure out what is owed to their team in incentive compensation. Other companies rely on spreadsheets to manage commission calculations.

Each of these solutions creates problems. Manual calculations lead to avoidable admin costs and scope for error. Spreadsheets are simply not efficient when managing commissions for large teams. 

This is especially true in the case of tiered commission, or any situation where the total amount of incentive-based salary is based on tenure or seniority.

Spreadsheets also create unnecessary security risks around sales reps' and customers' sensitive data.

Dedicated commission calculation software offers superior usability, customization, security, and efficiency.

### What should a commission calculator include?

Commission calculators are simple [CRUD apps](https://budibase.com/blog/crud-app/), comprising of two elements:

1. A **data layer**, for storing sales records and automating calculations.
2. A **front-end interface**, for gathering, displaying, and managing data around sales compensation.

Users can record sales through the app’s front end. The data layer is used to store this information and apply your calculation rules.

The best commission calculator tools provide additional features to fully streamline processes. For example, third-party integrations, custom automations, and other advanced functionality.

You might like to add additional short term incentives around selling certain volumes worth of a product. Or, you might want to create custom screens around analytics for total commissions or average commission rates.

### Custom calculation rules

Our template offers different commission percentages to employees, based on their length of service. Employees receive a 5% commission in their first year, 10% in years two to five, and 15% in years five to ten. Beyond this, they’ll receive an extra 0.5% for each year of service.

With Budibase, it’s easy to build your own custom rules, using formula variables. Adjust rates and service thresholds, or add new variables to your calculation rules, using handlebars expressions or our built-in JavaScript editor.

We’ve provided separate formula variables for employees’ current commission rate, and their rate at the time of each sale. This ensures accuracy, even when dealing with back-dated or historical data.

### Role-based access control

Our template offers customizable RBAC. Maximize your app’s security and usability, by granting each user the exact permissions they need. Restrict screens and data to different permission tiers, at the press of a button.

Grant permissions based on your employees’ job role, department, seniority, and more.

We’ve built our template around two levels of access. _Basic_ users can register sales, and view their colleagues’ overall performance. _Power_ users can access more detailed sales reports, histories, and individuals’ commission data.
