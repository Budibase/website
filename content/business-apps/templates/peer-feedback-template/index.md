Employees are often the best judges of their colleagues’ performance. Peer feedback is used to gain an accurate picture of each employee’s output, as well as providing an opportunity for colleagues to comment on each other's work, outside of regular review processes.

For example, a team member might want to highlight a time when one of their colleagues went above and beyond. Other times, they may need to leave feedback to highlight areas where their peers can improve.

Our template is the fast and easy way to build a feedback culture within your organization.

## What is a peer feedback tool?

Peer feedback tools are simple [CRUD applications](https://budibase.com/blog/crud-app/) that allow users to create, view, and manage employee evaluations. The goal is to maximize peer-to-peer learning, by making it as easy as possible to leave feedback on colleagues' strengths and weaknesses.

This replaces ad-hoc processes, including managing feedback in meetings, calls, emails, or other informal communications.

Using a dedicated tool also ensures that feedback is gathered in a consistent format. This is crucial for analyzing data and automating follow-up actions.

### Why digitize feedback workflows?

Most businesses have no system in place for employees to evaluate their peers. This creates two problems:

1. Employees are less likely to give feedback to their peers.
2. When employees do give feedback, there’s no consistent way to analyze, learn from, share, or leverage this information.

Digitalization eliminates the barriers to providing effective peer feedback and ensures consistency. This allows you to analyze your employees' performance over time, or against their colleagues.

As with any evaluation tool, the ultimate goal is to identify opportunities for learning and improvement. Digital feedback management tools also allow you to track your employee’s progress against set targets or personal development goals.

### What should an employee feedback tool contain?

Employee feedback tools are made up of two elements:

1. A data layer, for storing and organizing feedback information.
2. A front-end information for submitting, viewing, and managing feedback.

Employees use the app’s front-end to search for colleagues and complete peer feedback forms. All submissions are then stored against the respective employee in the back-end.

The idea is to build a feedback-driven culture, by allowing your employees to learn from one another on an ongoing basis.

The most effective tools offer extra functionality for streamlining internal processes. For example, third-party integrations, custom automations, and external database support.

## Our peer feedback template

We’ve built our peer feedback system to offer maximum usability, functionality, and deployability. Gather, manage, share, and analyze employee feedback with a single intuitive tool.

Our template offers:

* Complete customization.
* External data support.
* Process automation.
* Intuitive UI.
* Custom RBAC.
* Third-party integrations.
* Responsive design.
* Optional self-hosting.
* Searchability and filtering.
* Streamlined workflows.

Use Budibase templates as deployment-ready solutions, or customize them to closely match your existing workflows.

### Intuitive peer feedback UIs

Empower your users to leave detailed peer feedback, in seconds. Our template is built around a single-screen interface, offering maximum efficiency. Users can perform all kinds of CRUD actions, at the press of a button.

We’ve used conditional UIs, modal screens, and other innovative design features to create a slick, lightweight user experience.

Maximize app adoption by giving your team a peer feedback tool that they’ll love to use.

![Peer Feedback Form](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1647959957/cms/Peer_feedback_template_2_oow2vh.png "Peer Feedback Form")

### Multi-step forms

Our [multi-step form interfaces](https://budibase.com/forms) are the perfect way to gather consistent, detailed information. Each form-step deals with a single type of feedback, ensuring maximum accuracy and relevance.

Employees are asked to provide their own details, rate their colleagues on a range of Likert Scales, and provide long-form comments on different elements of their peers’ performance.

Budibase forms are fully customizable. Edit any element of your forms’ design or data, to meet your specific requirements.

![Likert Scale](https://res.cloudinary.com/daog6scxm/image/upload/v1647959983/cms/Peer_feedback_template_3_hfesi9.png "Likert Scale")

### Automated performance scoring

We’ve provided a series of formula variables to numerically score your employees, based on peer feedback. Our feedback forms use Likert Scale questions to assess key elements of your team’s performance.

Our formula variables automatically transform this into a numerical score, for each feedback submission.

Each employee is then given an average rating, based on all feedback they’ve received. We’ve also created auto-generated feedback reports, for each form completion.

### Conditionality

Craft incredible users experiences with conditional UIs. Display, hide, or update design elements, using custom rules. Set conditions using form inputs, user information, behavior, or stored data.

We’ve used conditionality to consolidate different interfaces, packing maximum functionality into our single-screen template.

Use conditionality rules to create powerful branched form UIs, or display truncated interfaces to mobile users.

### Custom RBAC

Budibase makes it easy to control how different users access your data. We offer customizable role-based access control, to maximize security and usability. Give each user the exact level of access they need to do their jobs effectively.

Restrict apps screens, data, and functions to different permission tiers, with our simple drop-down editors.

We’ve built our template around two permission tiers. _Basic_ users can search for employees and provide feedback. _Power_ users can then review submissions and feedback scores for each employee.

### Responsive Design

Our peer feedback template is totally mobile-responsive. All of our design elements automatically resize to fit perfectly on desktop, mobile, or tablet devices. Budibase components are also thoroughly accessibility tested.

With our template, employees can submit feedback anywhere, from any device.

Maximize internal learning and build a feedback culture in your business, with a tool that your team can take wherever they go.

### Customizable data fields

Our template offers complete customization. Add, edit, or remove any variables in your app’s data layer. Use our auto-generated screens and field groups to update forms at the press of a button.

Budibase offers a wide range of innovative form components and data types, including Markdown editors, formula variables, date selectors, simple text and number fields, and more.

Create automated taxonomies using formula variables, Handlebars expressions, relational data, and our built-in JavaScript editor.
