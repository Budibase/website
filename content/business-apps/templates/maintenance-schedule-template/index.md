All kinds of businesses use preventative maintenance schedules. Different kinds of equipment, including tools, vehicles, and digital devices, require regular servicing to work correctly.

Regular servicing helps to prevent disruption, risks, and unnecessary repair bills. However, this is challenging with large fleets, networks, or inventories. As such, effective organization is key.

## What is a maintenance schedule?

Maintenance schedules are used to track and manage different equipment’s servicing needs. Essentially, this means keeping a record of each item’s servicing history and maintenance intervals.

The goal is to ensure that each piece of equipment receives the regular maintenance work that it needs to operate properly in the short and long term. An effective maintenance schedule also creates a paper trail for all servicing actions.

However, when this is done manually, it can create a huge administrative workload.

This is where digitalized maintenance planning comes in.

### Why digitize maintenance scheduling?

Digitizing maintenance scheduling enables businesses to effectively manage equipment servicing, without creating additional admin costs. Naturally, tracking maintenance tasks with pen and paper takes a huge amount of time.

It also brings the potential for human error.

This can mean missing essential maintenance, or overspending on unnecessary services. Digitizing your maintenance scheduling workflows simultaneously improves outcomes and cuts administrative costs.

### What does a maintenance schedule app include?

Maintenance scheduling apps essentially have two components. These are:

* A database for tracking your equipment’s maintenance needs.
* A front-end interface for users to view, manage, and action different types of maintenance processes.

In other words, a maintenance schedule app automatically tracks when servicing is due. It then notifies your team and allows users to record when tasks are completed. This means collecting and maintaining data on equipment usage and maintenance needs.

For example, you might set different maintenance intervals based on usage or time-based rules. When these conditions are met, your maintenance schedule app automatically designates these as in need of service.

## Our maintenance schedule template

We’ve created an intuitive and powerful scheduled maintenance template. With it, you can streamline routine maintenance workflows, without the need for costly custom development.

Our maintenance schedule template offers:

* Customizable design.

### Track and manage equipment maintenance

Our template is built to streamline maintenance scheduling processes. Simply set the service interval and last service date for all entries. We’ve provided automations to calculate the next service date for each piece of equipment and notify your team.

On the app’s home screen, you’ll find a real-time notification center, listing all entries which are due for maintenance.

We’ve also provided intuitive form interfaces for editing devices, viewing service notes, and registering task completion. In seconds, your team can locate, action, and record maintenance tasks.
