Internal IT teams are busier than ever, and with remote working becoming the new norm, triaging and solving coworker technical issues is getting harder. This leads to overworked IT support teams and unproductive employees. At Budibase, we’re all about empowering employees to do their best work, so we’ve created this modern IT ticketing system template. And, to make life easier, it’s free and you can self-host the template alongside Budibase.

## Keep on top of support queries

Support queries come at you from all angles, at all times of the day. The purpose of this template is to help keep on top of support queries, and prevent them from falling through the cracks.  With Budibase, we can build secure, intuitive applications with minimal coding skills.

## What’s included in the ticketing system template?

Our application is built around two distinct user roles - service users and agents. Let's check out what each one can do across each section of the Budibase builder.

## Data

Our IT ticketing template is built on top of two tables in BudibaseDB, with distinct views for each of our user roles. The first is the Tickets table. This is where we store all of the relevant details of each submitted ticket, including its title, description, category, status, original submitter. We'll also use this to record other information across its lifecycle, including the agent that picks it up, their notes, and the timestamp of the most recent update.

Most of these require user inputs. However, some, including Date Created and Status are automatically populated using Budibase's default values.

Each of our user roles can interact with our data through specific *Views*. The *Submitter* View enables Service Users to create new tickets by providing basic details, including a title, description, category, and relevant attachements. They then have Read-Only access to other columns, but this is limited to only the rows they have created.

Service Agents have Write permissions for a wider range of columns, as well as Read access across all rows, regardless of who created them. We've also created an additional View called Open Status Count, which returns the Count of all Tickets rows which currently have their Status set to Submitted.

Our second table is used to log changes to the Status attribute of our tickets, including columns for the date these change, the old value, and the new value.

## UIs

Out template consists of two core UIs, relating to each of our user roles. Our service user UI provides a streamlined experience for performing controlled CRUD actions.

This is based around our Table Layout, which has been autogenerated from the *Submitter View*, inheriting all of its access rules. Users can two modal screens. The first contains a form for submitting new tickets. The second allows them to view the full details of their previous submissions, including information added by service agents. This also contains a button that enables the user to cancel a specified ticket.

Service agents are able to access a similar, but slightly more in-depth UI, including front-end filtering based on the Status attribute. This enables them to expand the details of any Ticket, and update key fields including the ticket's Status, Category, Priority, and Agent Notes. This screen also includes additional features, such as cards to display key statistics about our tickets and a separate modal for viewing the Status History data of each submission.

## Automations

Our template utilizes two distinct automation rules to show off some of what is possible when building workflow tools in Budibase. The first of these is a *Row Action* called *Cancel*. Row Actions are automation rules that users can trigger on specific rows in a database table. Ours simply updates the status of the relevant Tickets row to *Cancelled*. This is triggered using the *Cancel* button on our service users screen.

Our other automation rule is called *Log History*. This uses an *App Action* trigger, which accepts three arguments - *PreviousStatus*, *NewStatus*, and *id*. If *PreviousStatus* is not equal to *NewStatus*, all three variables are logged on a new row on our Status History table. This also records a timestamp using a default value under the Date Updated column.

This is then triggered with relevant arguments in each of the locations where users can update a Ticket row, across both of our app screens.

Budibase automations offer huge scope for customization, including a range of built-in triggers and actions, alongside branching and looping logic. There's never been an easier way to automate end-to-end processes in a single flow.

Since Budibase is free and open-source, you can customize the helpdesk template in any way you want, to make sure it adapts to your support processes.

With it, you can create your own IT ticket template. Therefore, users know what kind of information they need to provide. You can customize your templates with new fields, new actions, and new alerts.

Another interesting approach is to analyze the support metrics. You can create custom metrics and track them automatically or with some user interaction.

For example, you can track the number of replies needed to close an issue, or how many tickets there are in a category.

With this information, you can check common issues, create guides in your helpdesk app or even consider adding new features to solve the most common issues.
