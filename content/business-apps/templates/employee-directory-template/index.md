In the age of remote working, collaboration is difficult. Let your employees find and collaborate with colleagues, no matter where they are.

In just a few minutes, you can build an effective web app to store employee information. Budibase gives you total control over all features and data fields within your company directory.

## What is an employee directory?

An employee directory is a central resource for key information about your staff. For instance, names, job roles, or contact details. That way, you can easily store and find important employee information.

An effective employee directory empowers your team to contact their colleagues in seconds. The best directories improve efficiency by integrating with existing communication channels.

### Why do you need an employee directory?

The way we work has transformed over the last few years, with the rise of remote teams. For many, walking across the office and tapping a colleague on the shoulder is a distant memory.

Organizations of all kinds need employee directories for effective internal communications.

Even today, many human resources teams fall back on spreadsheets to keep track of employee profiles. This compromises security, efficiency, and user experience.

Creating an employee directory is a quick and easy way to save time, achieve better results, and encourage a culture of collaboration between team members, while managing data in a centralized location.

### What should an employee directory include?

Every business is different. What your employee directory should include depends on the information your staff needs to do their jobs. Of course, most directories still have some things in common.

Most basic employee directory software includes three clusters of information:

1. **Personal information** like names, locations, and birthdays.
2. **Professional information** like job titles, departments, and start dates.
3. **Employee contact information** like email addresses and phone numbers.

Still, you don’t want to limit yourself to these data fields. You might choose to add more specific job-related information, like key skills. Staff bios can help build remote relationships between your employees.

Our open-source employee directory template gives you complete control to store the right data for your business.
