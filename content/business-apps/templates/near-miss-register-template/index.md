Most businesses record incidents when someone gets hurt or property gets damaged. The goal here is to learn lessons and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Sometimes employees come away from incidents unscathed. Your business can learn just as much here.

Our template is a fast, intuitive, and cost-effective way to record and learn from near-misses.

## What is a near-miss register?

As the name suggests, a near-miss register is used to record incidents that have the potential to cause injury or death, even when they don’t. Say a pallet in your warehouse falls from the shelf and lands a few feet from one of your stock pickers.

We'd say this is a close call. No one got hurt, but if the situation had been a little bit different, the consequences could have been dire.

This is a near-miss.

A traditional incident register might only record this if the employee actually got hurt. This prevents you from putting measures in place to stop a similar incident from occurring, just because the employee happened to get lucky.

This is far from the ideal solution for risk assessments, workplace safety, or incident management.

Recording near misses helps to quickly and easily ensure that every possible action is taken by safety officers to keep your employees safe from harm - including preventing future incidents that might result in injury or damage.

### Why digitize near-miss records?

Many businesses still log incidents using pen and paper. Often, this means reporting the incident to the foreman or a HR colleague, who then logs it manually. This creates several issues.

Employees might neglect to report near-misses if they’re unable to contact the responsible person straight away. Creating a single gate-keeper for your incident logs can also prevent relevant information about near-misses from being recorded - or corrective actions carried out.

Or, they might not take certain types of incidents seriously at all.

Manually managing incidents also creates excessive admin work. This undermines your operational efficiency, by creating avoidable costs.

Digitalization eliminates all of these problems, with a dedicated near miss app being one of the most effective solutions.

### What should a near-miss register contain?

A near-miss register is built around two elements:

1. A front-end interface, where employees can record incidents.
2. A back-end data layer, for storing, categorizing and managing this data.

The crucial thing here is that any employee can create an incident record, in seconds. This provides a more streamlined reporting process, by eliminating barriers and unnecessary admin tasks.

The most effective near-miss reporting apps provide further functionality for streamlining workflows. For instance, third-party integrations, custom automations, and support for external data sources.

### Custom RBAC

Like all Budibase tools, our template offers fully customizable role-based access control. We’ve built our template around two levels of access. _Basic_ users can search, view, and submit near-miss reports.

_Power_ users can then edit reports which have already been submitted.

We also provide two additional permission tiers, that can be configured to any combination of app screens. Restrict access based on users’ job role, seniority, department, location, or any other attribute.
