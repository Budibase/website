An effective IT team is the heart of any successful organization. Asset maintenance and inventory management are key here. Ensuring that the right devices are accessible is critical to all other business processes.

When done properly, asset management helps to ensure profitability, by reducing admin costs. When assets are managed poorly, businesses are exposed to risks, inefficiencies, and poor outcomes.

## What is IT asset management?

Asset management is all about making sure that your business gets the most value out of each of its devices. This means maximizing utility, while minimizing losses and risks, across your entire inventory.

For IT teams, there are many key challenges here:

* Accounting for all devices.
* Deploying assets to where they are needed.
* Maintaining and servicing your inventory.
* Managing costs.
* Patch management.
* Lifecycle management and retiring devices.

The goal is to ensure that your organization’s IT inventory is accessible, reliable, secure, and profitable.

### Why do you need asset management software?

Digital tools take the legwork out of IT asset management (ITAM). Countless organizations still manage hardware and software inventories using spreadsheets, emails, or even pen and paper. This is far from ideal.

Tracking and managing assets with manual tools creates avoidable admin work, risk, and scope for human error.

The alternative is using a dedicated IT asset management platform. Digital tools allow you to automate processes, eliminate risks, and provide more streamlined workflows.

### What do asset management tools include?

All asset management tools contain key features:

1. A database for managing device information.
2. A front-end interface for calling, querying and manipulating device data.

For example, businesses might store and use data on how devices are used, their cumulative cost over time, their maintenance needs, and more. Or, they might need to track other resources, like software licenses, mobile devices, network hardware, and more.

Our web-based open-source asset management system empowers you to use this information, without the need for advanced database skills. This saves time and money, by creating intuitive and streamlined asset tracking workflows for IT teams.

## Our open-source asset management template

Our IT asset management software is built for functionality and fast deployment.

With our free template, you’ll have access to asset management features including:

* External database support.
* Complete customization.
* Email automation.
* Intuitive UI.
* Custom permissions.
* Third-party integrations.
* Responsive design.
* Optional self-hosting.
* Custom automations.
* Streamlined processes.

Budibase is the fast and easy way to build asset management software.

### Streamlined asset management

Our template offers unrivaled device management experiences. We’ve provided multiple user-friendly screens for managing costs deployment, asset requests, and maintenance schedules.

We've based it on a simple two-step, two-role request and approval workflow. Users with the `Requestor` role can view available assets and submit requests, as well as viewing and cancelling their own previous submissions. `Approver` users are able to create and edit assets, respond to requests, or view the history and current deployment of individual deviced.

We've also added automated logic to prevent requests from clashing with one another by preventing users from booking an asset that's already been scheduled for the requested dates.

### Instant deployment and rental

A key part of asset management is deploying the right devices to the right users. Our template offers instantaneous asset requests. With a searchable inventory screen and intuitive rental form, employees can quickly and easily request the devices they need in real-time.

Our template is built around three databases for _assets_, _requests_, and _schedule_. When a user completes a rental form, a new row is created on the _requests_ table. This is linked to the respective row of the _assets_ table, using simple relationships

Your IT team can then search, view, manage, and approve all requests. When a request is approved, the relevant data is then added to the *schedule*, which is linked to the relevant rows in the two other tables.

### Role-based access control

Budibase offers customizable role-based access control. Set your own access rules, based on job role, seniority, department, and more. Take control over how different users interact with your app’s data.

Our template is built around two permissions tiers - `Requestors` and `Approvers`.

In Budibase users with the `App Admin` role have permissions to update your applications or edit any of the underlying data.

### Process automation

Budibase is the smart way to automate asset management workflows. Use any in-app action to trigger our wide library of built-in automations. We also offer a built-in JavaScript editor, and third-party integrations, to create powerful, custom automations.

Our template uses three distinct automation rules to handle scheduling conflicts, approvals, and request cancellations.

Add your SMTP credentials to trigger email automations using in-app actions, for streamlined communications.

### Responsive design

All of our app components and building blocks are fully mobile-responsive. Our asset management template works perfectly on all devices, with elements automatically scaling to fit the user’s screen.

Budibase also supports conditional UIs. Hide or display any design element, based on the user’s device, for a fully streamlined mobile UX.

Maximize app adoption, by giving your IT team an asset management tool they can take anywhere.
