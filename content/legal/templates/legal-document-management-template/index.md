Upload, store, organize, and share key legal documents with clients and colleagues, in seconds.

Legal firms handle huge volumes of documents and information. When this is disorganized it quickly leads to inefficiencies, miscommunications, human error, and poor client experiences.

It’s critical to have robust systems in place to manage legal documents. Effective document management reduces admin costs and improves outcomes. Give your employees and clients a fast and easy way to access, update, and share documents.

## What is document management software?

As the name suggests, document management tools are used to track and organize key information within law firms. This includes contracts, invoices, client details, case notes, project specs, and any other kind of documents your team might need.

In other words, users can upload, share, and update different kinds of documents.

The goal is to centralize information and ensure that your team can find the documents they need, in seconds. For law firms and legal departments, it’s also crucial for document management tools to be fully secure.

### Why do you need a document management tool?

Many law firms use shared drives, email chains, and even in-person meetings to manage documents. This is a risky approach, with unnecessary scope for security breaches and human error.

Centralizing documents allows you to reduce risk, eliminate admin costs, and supercharge profitability.

In most cases, without document management, it’s almost impossible for legal departments to operate effectively. Control who accesses different documents, for maximum security and usability.

### What should a document manager include?

Document management tools essentially contain two elements:

1. **A back-end data layer** for storing and organizing documents.
2. **A front-end interface** for creating, accessing, managing, and sharing documents.

The front-end is used to upload new documents, update their status, share them with colleagues, add comments, make changes, and more.

The best document management tools have additional features for managing and automating legal workflows. For instance, integrations with third-party tools and communication automations.

### Document request workflows

Manage and track document submissions and usage. We’ve provided a dedicated screen for clients and colleagues to request documents, in seconds. We’ve also added a _status_ field for each document and request, to simplify document management.

When a new request is submitted, your team can quickly upload the required documents, and share them instantly.

Our document request form uses a simple and intuitive interface to create a smooth user experience. We’ve also provided dedicated screens for filtering, accessing, and responding to document requests.

### Custom automation

Our template is the perfect platform for workflow automation. Use any in-app action to trigger our library of built-in automations. Automated document management workflows are the perfect way to cut admin costs, by reducing the need for manual inputs.
