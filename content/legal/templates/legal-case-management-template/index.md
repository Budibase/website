Share documents, manage costs, and track performance, with our powerful, intuitive platform.

Law firms and legal departments face a huge number of hidden costs. Admin tasks, internal communications, and inefficiencies quickly eat into profit margins. Streamlined case management is the key to consistent profits.

An effective case management tool reduces admin time, human error, and unnecessary meetings. With Budibase, you can create fully customized case management software, in minutes.

## What is case management software?

Law firms use case management software to track and manage workloads, documents, costs, project delivery, and more. This means centralizing case data and resources, as well as automating workflows to maximize efficiency.

A key priority is managing costs. This means delivering the best possible outcomes in each case while remaining within agreed budgets.

The goal is achieving maximum ROI, across all cases and projects.

Case management software achieves this in two ways:

1. Providing oversight of project spending.
2. Reducing and eliminating unnecessary operational costs.

### Why do you need case management software?

Legal workflows are some of the most admin-intensive of any business function.

Even simple legal tasks include extensive analysis, approval processes, information sharing, and communications. In the past, this has made workflow automation difficult within legal departments.

Case management software is the first step towards overcoming this.

Digitizing your workflows allows you to identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement. This means simplifying admin processes and leveraging automations to reduce operational costs.

### What should case management tools contain?

At a basic level, case management software is made up of two elements:

1. **A back-end data layer** for storing information and resources on cases, clients, and tasks.
2. **A front-end interface** for accessing, managing, and analyzing this data.

The data layer stores case details, including specifications, budgets, relevant documents, stakeholders, and costs incurred. Your team can then use the app’s front-end to access, edit, and manage these details.

The most effective case management tools offer additional functionality, including automated actions, high levels of usability, and integration with third-party tools.

Every legal department has unique processes. As such, case management tools must offer high levels of customization. To deliver ROI, case management software should fully match your existing workflows.

## Our case management template

Our case management template is a fully deployable solution, with total scope for customization. Use our leading open-source, low-code platform to tailor our template to your specific needs.

### Centralize case management data

Our case management template is the easy way to centralize information, data, documents, and resources. We’ve built our template around three linked databases for _cases_, _case leads_, and _timesheets_.

Quickly update project budgets, spending, requirements, documentation, statuses, and more.

Use our template to categorize and organize cases and resources. We’ve also provided functionality for calculating, analyzing, and managing spending across cases.

### Track spending and project budgets

Our template offers exceptional cost management for legal cases. Set project budgets rates for each individual case. Employees can quickly log time against projects, automatically updating the total spend in real-time.

Analyze spending by case, client, or project lead, in seconds.

Our cost management tools are based around simple formula variables. Use handlebars expressions or our built-in JavaScript editor to create custom rules. With Budibase, it’s easy to build cost controls that fully match your internal processes and billing procedures.

### Role-based access control

Budibase offers fully customizable role-based access control. Assign permissions to different users, based on their location, seniority, job role, department, and more. Use simple dropdown menus to restrict or enable app screens within any permission tier.

We’ve built our template around two permission tiers. _Basic_ users can access and manage all data relating to _cases_ and _timesheets_. _Admins_ can view analytics screens, and assign, change, edit, or remove _project leads_.

Customize our permission tiers to match your departmental structure. We’ve also provided two additional permission tiers, to assign access to _public_ and _power_ users.

### Workflow automation

Our template is built to automate legal workflows. Trigger our library of automations using any in-app action. Use handlebars expressions, formula variables, conditional UIs, third-party integrations, or our built-in JavaScript editor to create powerful custom functions.

With Budibase, it’s easy to automate everything from project approval, to invoicing, document sharing, status reports, and more.

Add your SMTP credentials to trigger automated emails with our case management template, or connect directly to external communications tools.

### Filtering and searchability

Filter, search, and locate key case information, in seconds. We’ve provided _dynamic filter_ components throughout our case management solution. Filter listings pages, based on any combination of variables.

Use a range of simple and numerical filter expressions to find the exact entries you need, across all back-end datasets.

With simple _exact-match_ queries, our dynamic filters can be used as powerful search forms. Quickly access key data, resources, and information for any case, client, or project.

### Analytics and visualization

Our case management template offers advanced analytics and data visualization. We’ve provided in-depth charts for analyzing spending, budgets, and hours used across all cases and projects.

Use dynamic filtering to group and analyze cases, based on their project lead, client, budget, and more.

We’ve also added budget snapshots to each individual case’s detail screen, providing quick and easy insights into expenditure.
