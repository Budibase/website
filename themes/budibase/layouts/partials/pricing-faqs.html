        <p class="text-xs">Most software pricing is designed to charge you per user regardless of how many people on your
            team are actively using the software. At Budibase, you only get billed for what you use, so you don’t pay
            for the users who aren’t using Budibase. Fair’s fair. <b>With day passes, if a user uses Budibase on a single calendar day, one day pass is used. For example, if a user uses Budibase (including apps built) on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but not Thursday and Friday - that's 3 day passes deducted from your monthly quota. </b></p>

            <summary>Do you charge for users?</summary>
            <p class="mb-2 text-sm mx-3">At Budibase, you only get billed for what you use, so you don’t pay for the
                users who aren’t using Budibase. It's usage based pricing, rather than user based.</p>

            <p class="mb-2 text-sm mx-3">All payments are made via credit card using Stripe for Pro, Team, and Business workspaces. For
                Enterprise accounts, we can issue an annual invoice with payment via PO. Please <a href="/contact"

            <summary>How does annual pricing work?</summary>
            <p class="mb-2 text-sm mx-3">The way that this works for annual payments is that we charge you the base subscription price at the time of your upgrade (and then yearly). If you require additional day passes, you have the ability to switch between tiers - prorata charges will apply.  </p>

            <summary>Do you have a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)?</summary>
