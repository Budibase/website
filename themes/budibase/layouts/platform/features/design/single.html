            <p class="lead mb-6">After you've set your data up, you can generate a fully working CRUD app with 3 clicks. We're pretty proud of this feature and excited for you to try this out!</p>

            <h5 class="h4 mb-2">Pre-built components</h5>
            <p class="lead mb-6">Budbase has over 30 pre-built components to help you build production-grade apps people enjoy using, really quickly.</p>

            <h5 class="h4 mb-2">Coding optional</h5>
            <p class="lead mb-6">With Budibase, coding is optional. For no-coders, it's simple to build an app without JS. For developers, from adding logic to your components to transforming data, Budibase allows to write JavaScript almost anywhere in the builder.
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4 mb-2">Apps that work on mobile, tablet, desktop</h5>

            <h5 class="h4 mb-2">Create forms on top of your database</h5>
            <p class="lead mb-6">Whilst other form builders require you collect and store data on their databases/servers, with Budibase you can generate/build forms on top of multiple databases including PostgreSQL, MYSQL, Mongo and more, allowing you to store data in your own database on your own servers (if self-hosting).</p>

            <h5 class="h4 mb-2">Multi-step forms</h5>
            <p class="lead mb-6">Create multi-step forms and surveys with ease using Budibase. As always, Budibase's flexibility allows you to add actions, validation and logic to each step.</p>

            <h5 class="h4 mb-2">Validation</h5>
            <p class="lead mb-6">With Budibase you can set up a whole host of form validation rules - including regex support and some built in validations common with form based apps. Provide custom validation messages for each of your conditions for total validation control and tailored user feedback. </p>

            <h5 class="h4 mb-2">Highly customizable</h5>
            <p class="lead mb-6">Forms come in all shapes and sizes and we understand that first hand. For this reason, users can build forms of all levels of complexity with Budibase; including adding extra information for each question, multi-step forms, custom logic, validation, custom styling and mroe.</p>
