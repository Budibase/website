        The definitive guide to internal tools in 2021
      </h1>
      <p class="text-center text-light mb-4">
        My name is Joe Johnston and I am obsessed with internal tools. Over the
        last 10 years, I've created over 80 internal tools - one particular tool
        had over 80,000 users and saved the organization over $3,000,000 per
        annum. If this is your first time learning about internal tools, you've
        came to the right place. This is NOT your average "Internal tools in
        2021" post. This is a continually evolving environment to learn about
        the finer details of building internal tools, and how they can help you
        accelerate digital transformation.

            Internal tools are internally-facing software developed and utilised within an
            organization. They range from database GUIs to employee wikis, and

          Internal tools have been around since the early days of software
          development. They're the unsung hero that powers the
          majority of businesses which exist today. And they're growing in
          popularity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">
          Software is eating the world, and digital transformation is at the top
          of every CIO/CTOs agenda. $120 billion was spent last year on Internal
          tools/custom software, and this figure will continue to increase as we
          gather more data, become more distributed, and industries become more

        <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4">Examples of internal tools</h3>
        <p>
          Below are examples of internal tools used within companies
          and a general list of popular internal tools we've seen users build
          within Budibase.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-6 mb-4">Companies that use internal tools</h4>
        <img class="u-avatar mt-4" src="/img/internal-tools/google-logo.png" alt="Google logo" loading="lazy">
        <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Google internal tools</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Google are infamous for their internal tools. I have spoken with a few
          product managers at Google and I'm under good authority they have over 500
          internal tools in the wild. Some of those tools have hit the
          headlines, including the two below:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Google's internal browser -</b> Google developed an internal
          browser tool that monitors meeting requests made by employees. This
          has upset a number of employees, whom have spoken out about the new
          internal tool. A Google representative denied the tool was for
          'spying', saying the company developed the extension in response to an
          uptick in spam involving calendar entries. Basically, the tool alerts
          employees when they attempt to auto-add a meeting to the calendars of
          large numbers of people. The extension does not prevent users from
          creating such meetings and doesn't collect personal information.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          <b>Google's Borgmon (now Monarch) - </b> As you can imagine, Google
          has a collosal task on its hands monitoring its computer systems. The
          teams behind tools such as YouTube, Gmail, etc, need to monitor a
          continually growing and changing collection of heterogeneous entities
          including visual machines, devices, containers. The total of entities
          stretches into the billions and, to make matters more difficult, are
          distributed around the globe. So, Google built Borgmon. Any Google
          engineer, between 2004 and 2014, will have fond memories of Borgmon -
          it was a beast and involved a steep learning curve - but it worked, to
          a degree. Google have since replaced Borgmon with Monarch, which can
          manage trillions of time series and is essential to the smooth running
          of the Google engineering empire.

        <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Airbnb</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          You cannot hit IPO without experimentation. Airbnb understood this
          from the very beginning. They state:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "At Airbnb we are always trying to learn more about our users and
          improve their experience on the site. Much of that learning and
          improvement comes through the deployment of controlled experiments."
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          To run and manage their many experiences, Airbnb created an internal
          tool. The tool did all the heavy analytical lifting automatically,
          whilst limiting bias when setting up an expierment. When designing the
          tool in 2014, simplicity was the primary goal, and it shows:
        </p>

        <img class="u-avatar mt-9" src="/img/internal-tools/stripe-logo.png" alt="Stripe icon" loading="lazy">
        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Stripe</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          On a call with David Singleton, CTO at Stripe, we asked him if they
          prefered to "build vs buy". His answer was
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "Build, depending on the scale of the task at hand. For example, we
          use Github, because the engineering effort to build a tool like Github
          is not worth our time and engineering effort."
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          This is a quintessential answer. Below is a design of one of Stripe's
          many internal tools, called Home. Home is Stripe's employee resources
          portal. It provides directories for employees and teams, as well as
          company-wide resources like calendars, events and announcements.
        </p>

          alt="airbnb internal tool ui"
        />
        <p class="mt-2">
          Credit to Stripe, their design always seems to strikes the perfect
          balance between beauty, and communicating 'we're an incredible
          technical company'. It's great to see a company apply the same effort
          to design in their internal tools, as they do their external tools.

        <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4">6 Popular internal tools</h3>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">CRM</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          A CRM (customer relationship manager) helps sales/marketing teams
          manage their prospects/clients. There are many off-the-shelf CRMs including
          Salesforce, Pipedrive, etc, but many organizations build their own
          CRMs due to the unique nature of their sales process. I worked in the
          defence industry and we used Microsoft Dyanamics. It was a great
          platform, but due to the uniqueness of our sales process, the sales
          team hated it. It was not fit for purpose. We spent north of $40,000
          customizing the tool to fit our needs, but still, it did not suffice.
          So we built our own and the team loved it.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Dashboard / Database GUI</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Data is eating the world. As more organizations and processes move online, 
          the more data we obtain. Collecting data is generally the easy part, it's the interpretation of this data which is hard. In many cases, data is distributed across multiple data sources, making it a little tricky to compile and analyse. Many companies build internal tools / dashboards to help display this data in a way which is easily interpreted. This is one of the primary reasons why Budibase supports many different data sources including Mongo DB, Couch DB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, CSV, Dyanmo DB, and more.
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Admin Panel</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Many SaaS / eccomerce platforms require an admin panel to manage
          backend operations. They allow you to approve user access, manipulate
          data, and track transactions. Admin panels often have a dashboard
          element built-in to save time exporting data to another platform. Like
          all items on this list, the decision to build an admin panel is
          usually down to a custom requirement which is not available of-the-shelf.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Approval Apps</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Generally speaking, the larger the organizaton the more layers of management it has. A popular process within organizations, especially enterprise, is the approval process. This category can involve many, highly specific approval processes, from booking holidays to signing-off on a sale. When building this type of internal tool, understanding the different types of users and their hierarchy, is crucial. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Inventory apps</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Inventory can take many forms; from rockets to Tamagotchis. Managing
          this inventory involves a robust database, a interactive UI, and
          automations to accelerate the processes involved with managing
          shipments, orders, and deliveries. Often, a control dashboard where a
          manager can gain a snapshot of operations, is also required.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">IT Support ticketing tool</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          There are many departments within a business which require software to
          do their job more effectively - Sales have the CRM, HR have the HR
          platform, and IT Support have the ticketing system (among others). The
          core function of an IT ticketing system is to manage incoming support
          requests from general employees. As you can imagine, the life of an IT
          support technician can get stressful. Hardware/software have changed
          our lives, but they are complicated beasts and come with many
          problems. Combine that, with stressful/over-worked employees, and you
          get tickets of fury coming at you from all angles, 24 hours a day.
          This is exactly why a good ticketing system is essential. It helps IT
          Support plan, triage, dissemenate, and inform - allowing them to do
          their job with an impressive level of calmness and efficiency.

        Internal tools are generally built by developers, and if we're
        honest, they're not the pieces of work developers like to work on.
        But this is changing. Due to recent advancements in tooling. These
        advancements have reduced the learning curve, abstracted a lot of the
        more difficult technical parts, and made it super quick to build
        internal tools. This has led to a new wave of internal tool developers.
        Below we will explore the types of users building internal tools with
        Budibase.
      </p>
      <br />

      <hr class="p-2" />

      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">The illustrious internal tools developer</h3>
      <p>
        The illustrious internal tools developer is often the unsugn hero in
        many cases. They are building mission critical software, but often don't
        get the recognition they deserve. Over 40% of Budibase's users are
        developers of some type. Their general reasons for using a low code platform, include speed, ease of design, and simplicity.
      </p>
      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">The highly versatile product manager</h3>
      <p>
        Product managers are an emerging role which use to be reserved for
        larger organisations. We are beginning to see more product managers
        working within SMEs which is testiment to the importance of this role.
        The beauty of a product manager is they are 100% committed to a
        product; providing direction, ownership, and insights at all times. In a
        lot of cases, they're both technical and business focused - which is an
        incredibly powerful mix. Through conversations with PMs, one overarching
        theme has stood out for us - Product Managers fully understand the
        business value of these tools. Just under 20% of Budibase's signups are
        product managers, and growing!
      </p>
      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">The incredibly helpful IT Manager</h3>
      <p>
        Over 15% of Budibase users are IT managers. They generally belong to
        manufacturing / construction / logistics industries and work within a small
        team. Due to the nature of their business, we've found they are often
        building multiple internal tools, from inventory to CRMs, as their role
        primarily revolves around supporting the organizations internal
        technology and business operations. Around 15% of Budibase signups are IT managers or 'IT professionals'.
      </p>
      <h3 class="space-2-top mb-2">Additional Emerging roles</h3>
      <p>
        Below are two professional roles we were not aware of and we've
        noticed growing in popularity.
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Data PM</h4>
      <p>
        Due to the increasing importance and collection of data, we've noticed
        Data PMs signing up to Budibase. On inspection, their responsibilities
        lie within creating interfaces to make sense of the large amounts of
        data collected within their platforms. They then analyse this data to
        inform business direction. It's very much a data analyst / product
        manager hybrid - which seems like a role which could benefit almost
        every organization on earth.
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Product Ops</h4>
      <p>
        Basically, a product manager whose sole focus is on internal operations.
        We're noticed this role within larger organisations, and the
        low-code platform/internal tool builder seems to be their weapon on
        choice. We are watching this role very carefully, as it seems like it
        could grow in popularity as internal operations increase (due to digital
        transformation and the increasingly distributed workforce).

              Building internal tools is different from building 
              customer-facing tools. When building internal tools, you have
              greater access to the end-user. Quite often, when using an
              internal tool builder, the build process is a collaboration
              between builder and user. This is a beautiful, powerful experience
              and often results in an outstanding internal tool.

          There are primarily two ways to build an internal tool; completely
          with code, or with an internal tool builder.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-2">
          Both options have their pros and cons; code is more flexible; internal
          tool builders are faster, easier, and more cost effective.

        <p class="lead mb-2">
          Going forward, we will illustrate how to build an internal tool with
          an internal tool builder.

        <p class="lead mb-2">
          If you are leading the quest for a new internal tool, quite often you
          will need a business case or approval from the powers-of-be. For this
          post, we will assume you have approval.

          What is the Internal Development Methodology (IDM)
        </h3>
        <div class="p-4 bg-dark-2 mb-6 rounded-sm">
        <p
          class="lead text-white font-weight-semi-bold"
        >
          The internal development methodology is the method of building
          internal tools to automate processes, equip your workforce, and grow
          your organization. It’s about building tools to empower your employees
          to do more, and do it faster.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Why? Because when your employees succeed, you succeed.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">introducing the IDM flywheel</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The Internal Development Methodology can be applied in four ways:
        </p>
        <img
        src="/img/internal-tools/idm.png"
        class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4"
        alt="Why build internal tools"
      />
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Collaborate</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          To build an internal tool users love, you need the
          builder and the AU (admin user) to collaborate. Depending on the size
          of the organization, the team involved with building the internal tool may
          involve a product manager (if you can involve a product manager, do!).
          Collaboration provides motivation and enourages creativity; whilst
          reducing errors and upsets. During this phase, planning is completed,
          the project is scoped, and the architecture decided. In cases where
          the admin user is also the builder, it is still important to plan,
          scope, and architect.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Build</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Within Budibase, there are three phases to the build process; data, design, and automation. During the data phase, you structure your data, and add it to the builder. During the design phase, you build your application with pre-made components and screens. You can then pull in data to your components, and query them with incredible ease. And during the automation phase, you will automate certain processes such as email, notifications, and more. We feel the data, design, and automation pathway is the easiest to learn and the most natural for devs. Other internal tool builders may differ.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Test</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Testing should be completed across the relevant browsers and devices.
          It is a good idea, to test with a user who has not been exposed to the
          tool during development. It is up to the admin user to sign the
          internal tool off.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Deploy</h4>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Once the tool is signed off, you are ready to deploy it to production.
          The admin user will record any bugs experienced and collaborate with
          the builder to fix them - in some cases, due to their familiarity,
          they should be able to fix some issues.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          We've experimented with this methodology for over a year now and
          everytime it has resulted in superior internal tools, happier users,
          and advocates! And it's these advocates who promote this methodology,
          which results in more internal tools, happier employees, and faster,
          more productive businesses. This is how your organization builds
          momentum, and this is why the internal development methodology serves
          as a strong foundation for your flywheel.

        <hr class="p-2" />

        <h3 class="space-2-top mb-4">
          How does the methodology affect the user (employee)
        </h3>

        <p class="mb-4">
         As we previously mentioned, the internal development methodolgy can have a positive effect on your employees, equiping them to do more, faster. What's great about the methodolgy, is it also converts your employees into advocates, which spreads motivation.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Below outlines how IDM transforms a user into an advocate.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Collaborate (user)</b> - The AU (employee) is fully involved from
          the very beginning. They lead the planning, participate in scoping,
          and assist with architecture. In a sense, they are the product
          manager. They are the ones who fully understand the problem afterall.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Build (co-creator)</b> - The AU co-creates the internal tool,
          providing UI/UX feedback along the way. Co-creation is incredibly
          powerful, and made possible with internal tool builders such as Budibase.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Test (owner)</b> - The AU is also the tester. They understand the
          tool, they understand how it should perform, and what the common user
          will expect from it. They have the final say on whether or not the
          product is the ready for deployment - at this stage, they are the
          owner.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <b>Deploy (advocate)</b> - The AU, due to their heavy involvement, is
          the internal tool's advocate and first line of support for their team. They
          are the owner, they are the creator, they will promote the product to
          their team and gather feedback which then kickstarts the flywheel
          again. In some cases, they can make changes without the need of the
          internal tool developer.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Once the user becomes an advocate they sell the internal tool to their
          colleagues. Their colleagues, the new users, experience the platform
          and immediately begin considering how they can create internal tools
          to improve their jobs and provide the company with more value. The
          wheel keeps spinning, and a faster, happier workforce grows.

        <h3 class="space-2-top mb-4">
          Important considerations when building internal tools
        </h3>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Collaboration is key</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Better collaboration results in better internal apps. It also results
          in happier users, advocates, less bugs, less support, and less
          maintainence. Trust me, it's worth it!
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Infrastructure</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          When deploying your apps, it's important to understand where in the
          world your users will reside as this will impact perf. If you are in a
          highly secured environment, it's generally better to self-host your
          apps in the comfort of your own infrastructure.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Security</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Do you remember in the summer of 2020, when President Barack Obama,
          Joe Biden, and Elon Musks Twitter accounts were hacked? Well, the
          hackers managed to comprimise one of their internal tools and get
          access to their accounts. Please take security serious. Below is a picture of the
          internal tool:
        </p>
        <img
          src="/img/internal-tools/twitter.webp"
          class="img-fluid mt-4"
          alt="Twitter internal tool ui"
        />
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Extensibility</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          It's important to scope the internal tool to understand any areas
          that might require additional development outside of the internal
          tool builder. If there is development, please make sure your tool of
          choice is extensible and allows you to build on top of it - being able
          to see the codebase is a huge advantage here. This will also reduce
          technical debt.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Gather feedback and measure success</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          At Budibase, we like to include an NPS feedback popover in our apps. It
          asks the user to rate, from 1 to 10, how likely they are to rate this
          internal tool to a colleage. Underneath the scale, we include a
          comment box. This helps us understand the general feeling towards our
          app. Understanding feedback helps us build better tools.
        </p>
        <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Design matters</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          When building an internal tool, it is advised to think of your users
          like you would an external application. Uber have many internal tools,
          and Kamal Boparai, Engineering Manager, IT Eng Compliance and Legal
          (Engineering) Team puts it nicely in the statement below:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "The IT Eng team is very focused on our end users (Uber employees) and
          their experiences. We always put our end users first; from there, we
          can help external end users (Uber’s partners and customers) virtually.
          Even more importantly, we keep the Uber network functioning properly
          and create the infrastructure that supports Uber employees. Basically,
          IT Eng is responsible for everything that happens in the background to
          keep Uber running smoothly."<br />Kamal Boparai,Engineering Manager

                Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella once said, "Every company is now
                a software company". Software is without doubt changing every
                aspect of the workplace. What's more accurate and less heralded,
                is how we've only scratched the service when it comes to the
                productivity gains expected from software.

            2020 was a disatrous year for people around the world, and for many
            businesses too. The events in 2020 and 2021 will inevitably lead to
            organizations looking inwards to find answers. Building internal
            tools with internal tool builders can play a huge role in helping
            an organization cut costs whilst improving output.

          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Increased Productivity</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Internal tools have increased productivity across the board for the
            majority of industries, but the scale in which they're rolled out
            can make a huge difference.
            <a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/Optimize/pr_roi.html"
              >A study from 2003</a
            >
            showed that while Wal-Mart and Kmart both invested in IT, Wal-Mart
            did a better job of changing the rest of their business to work with
            the technology, and consequently saw “higher levels of productivity
            and market value”.
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Cost effective</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Of-the-shelf software, especially enterprise software, costs a
            crippling amount. When building internal tools with an internal tool
            builder, you can save 10x the cost of off-the-shelf software - sometimes a lot more! You
            can save even more if you self-host your tools on
            your own infrastructure. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Improved Security</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            If you are self-hosting on your own infrastructure, and implementing your own Auth system, in a lot of
            cases the security will be better.
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">More control</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            When building your own tools, you have the power to build them
            exactly how you want them. As previously mentioned, you are building
            a solution around your specific problem. One of the common reasons
            users come to Budibase to build custom software is because a part of
            their business is so unique that no off-the-shelf software can solve
            their problem how they'd like them to.
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">Happier employees (advocates)</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Providing your employees with the right tools to do their jobs is
            incredible fulfilling for employees. As I am sure you are aware, a
            common scenario in organizations is a disgruntled employee battling
            with an unfit tool, or using a particular tool to solve a problem
            the tool was not designed for. (We'll chat about Microsoft Office
            soon).
          </p>
          <h3 class="space-1-top mb-2">The technology is here</h3>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Previously it would take an internal software developer/development
            team, on average, 4 weeks to 6 months to build an internal tool.
            With modern internal tool builders, such as
            <a href="/">Budibase</a>, internal software developers can build and
            ship these same tools in days.

            Common alternatives to building Internal Tools
          </h3>
          <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">Sure, I've got Microsoft Office</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Microsoft Office is the workplace swiss army knife. We're grew up
            using it, loving it, and inevitably hating it. But, please don't see
            this as slander. It's an incredible platform, with incredible tools
            which solve common problems. In fact, a highly product Excel user is
            basically an engineer with a different title; building internal
            software (albeit in a highly restructive environment). The problem is how we
            overuse these tools to solve problems which they are not suitable
            for. Here's an example of how nearly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54423988">16,000 people who tested
              positive for the coronavirus disappeared from records due to an
              Excel error.</a>  
          </p>

            alt="Twitter internal tool ui"
          />
          <h4 class="space-1-top mb-2">I prefer to code my internal tools</h4>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Code is awesome. Boilerplate code and repetition not so much. We
            created <a href="/">Budibase</a> to augment the development experience not replace
            it. You can still write code, query data, self-host; but you can
            also develop faster, design better, and output a real single page
            application.

            The emergence of internal tool builders has reduced the barriers and
            resolved many of the concerns around building internal tools. If
            organizations were more willing to build their own internal tools,
            specific to their needs, they would experience huge productivity
            gains, an increase in employee satisfaction, and potential market
            growth. With
            digital transformation now a priority for most businesses, there has
            never been a better time to build internal tools and accelerate your
            organization forward. I hope you enjoyed this post, and thank you for reading.
