      <description>Every once in a while, I&amp;rsquo;ll come across examples of web application design that really draw me in. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed these web applications below and ranked them from 5 - 1.
These web applications contain a beautiful mix of design, usability and creativity. They are masterpieces, and wonderful tokens of inspiration.
Huge amounts of time and thought have went into the design of these web applications and credit must go to the designs.</description>

In fact, this is the process I’ve used, revised and perfected over the last 5 years.
I’ve used this exact process, or a version of it to build over 15 applications of all shapes and sizes. For me, this is 100% the best way to build web applications.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m the cofounder of Budibase - a super speedy web app builder for makers.
Over the last 15 years working on small to large (£15m+) projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve often considered what is success, and what are the good habits for success in 2019.
I&amp;rsquo;ve poured my thoughts on to this page to help others in a similar position, develop successful habits.
I hope you enjoy it.

      <description>With Chrome 72, you can now publish your PWA in the Play Store and from the browser.
Chrome 72 was shipped in November 2018 and included Tursted Web Activity (TWA) which allows you to open Chrome in standalone mode thanks to your native Android package.
The primary advantages over your normal PWA installation are:
 Home screen widget
 Offer a wear OS companion app
 Background services can access native features</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m often thinking of Micro SaaS ideas for my next project but most of the time they are either rubbish or I don&amp;rsquo;t have the capacity to pursue them.
Instead of throwing all the good ideas away, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to share them with you - how thoughtful, right 😄.

      <description>When someone whom you respect, approaches you with a business proposal, you listen. When their idea passes your gut validation, you get excited. When their vision of how a business should operate aligns with your vision, you fall in love with the product instantly. Your future brightens 💥
Respect, idea validation, shared vision. The 3 components of cofounder validation.
Respect can be earned, but best when it&amp;rsquo;s natural. Natural respect is only possible through previous encounters.</description>

      <title>About Budibase - A SaaS Builder To Help You Escape The 9-5</title>

      <description>If you have a software idea, you should have the freedom and confidence to pursue it. If you have a desire to work on your own terms, spend more time with your family and escape the rat race, your idea could be your ticket to freedom.
But sadly, reality likes to throw us obstacles. Mostly in the form of time. You work long structured hours, you have a family, and you’re working on other projects, so how can you possibly find the time to develop your idea?</description>
