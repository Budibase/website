      <title>The 5 best open source form builder apps (tried and tested)</title>

      <description>My name is Joe, and I have been building online forms for the last 10 years of my life. I have developed forms in several different ways; with html5 form builders, with Javascript form builders, to niche React form builders, and more. From my experience, I can conclude that the best open-source form builders make it quick and easy to create beautiful, functional, and accessible forms.
Forms are a critical construct of the digital age.</description>

      <title>6 tried and tested ways to get more Github Stars</title>
      <link>https://www.budibase.com/blog/github-stars/</link>

      <guid>https://www.budibase.com/blog/github-stars/</guid>
      <description>Over the last year, we&amp;rsquo;ve been building an open-source, low-code platform for developers and IT professionals. We&amp;rsquo;ve been so bogged down building the product and talking to users; we completely neglected the Budibase Github repo.
A trifling 83 stars in November presented a bleak assessment of the impact our repository had on passersby.
So, a few weeks back, we decided to give more thought to our Github repository. I would like to stipulate, we do not treat stars as the primary currency of successful open source projects.</description>

      <description>The world is eating software. üåé üç¥üåê
The above is a tongue-in-cheek response to the famous words of Marc Andreessen, &amp;lsquo;software is eating the world.&amp;rsquo; Marc&amp;rsquo;s words hail from his wondrous post, dated 2011, and titled, Why software is eating the world.
In 2011, software was indeed eating the world. A new wave of digital pathfinders developed and launched innovative software that would inevitably take the internet by storm. We had a surge of companies such as Amazon, Hubspot, Mailchimp, Salesforce, and Pipedrive.</description>

By now, developers recognize that web development tools play an integral role in the development process. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to build a web application without them! (I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be proven wrong here.)

      <description>It was the year 2010, I had an idea for a web application which would allow my family and I to share images, organise shopping, populate a shared calendar, and store bills. My family was terribly disorganised. We needed this!
This idea was going to make me üí∞üí∞üí∞.
There was a small complication with my vision - I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to build a web application. But thankfully, I could build a static site with HTML and CSS so it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard, right?</description>
