      <description>The world is eating software. üåé üç¥üåê
The above is a tongue-in-cheek response to the famous words of Marc Andreessen, &amp;lsquo;software is eating the world.&amp;rsquo; Marc&amp;rsquo;s words hail from his wondrous post, dated 2011, and titled, Why software is eating the world.
In 2011, software was indeed eating the world. A new wave of digital pathfinders developed and launched innovative software that would inevitably take the internet by storm. We had a surge of companies such as Amazon, Hubspot, Mailchimp, Salesforce, and Pipedrive.</description>

      <description>No-code tools empower people around the world to build technology without code. Before no-code tools, building a simple web application was a challenging task, and often left to developers. Thankfully, this is not the case anymore. While no-code tools cannot solve all technical challenges, having the right no-code stack can undoubtedly help you get certain jobs done a lot faster, easier, and cheaper.
There are hundreds of no-code tools available, some free and some expensive.</description>

      <description>What does a doctor, builder, and developer have in common?
They are all highly skilled individuals who use tools to improve their workflow and do their jobs.
By now, developers recognize that web development tools play an integral role in the development process. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to build a web application without them! (I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be proven wrong here.)
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ve rounded up some of the most helpful tools for developing a successful web application.</description>

      <description>It was the year 2010, I had an idea for a web application which would allow my family and I to share images, organise shopping, populate a shared calendar, and store bills. My family was terribly disorganised. We needed this!
This idea was going to make me üí∞üí∞üí∞.
There was a small complication with my vision - I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to build a web application. But thankfully, I could build a static site with HTML and CSS so it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard, right?</description>

Huge amounts of time and thought have went into the design of these web applications and credit must go to the designs.</description>

      <description>With Chrome 72, you can now publish your PWA in the Play Store and from the browser.
Chrome 72 was shipped in November 2018 and included Tursted Web Activity (TWA) which allows you to open Chrome in standalone mode thanks to your native Android package.
The primary advantages over your normal PWA installation are:
  Home screen widget
  Offer a wear OS companion app
  Background services can access native features</description>
