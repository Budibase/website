The above is a tongue-in-cheek response to the famous words of Marc Andreessen, &amp;lsquo;software is eating the world.&amp;rsquo; Marc&amp;rsquo;s words hail from his wondrous post, dated 2011, and titled, Why software is eating the world.

      <description>What does a doctor, builder, and developer have in common?

There was a small complication with my vision - I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to build a web application. But thankfully, I could build a static site with HTML and CSS so it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard, right?</description>
