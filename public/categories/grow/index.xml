      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m the cofounder of Budibase - a super speedy web app builder for makers.
Over the last 15 years working on small to large (Â£15m+) projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve often considered what is success, and what are the good habits for success in 2019.
I&amp;rsquo;ve poured my thoughts on to this page to help others in a similar position, develop successful habits.
I hope you enjoy it.
