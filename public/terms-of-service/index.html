<h3 id="31-responsibility-for-your-applications">3.1 Responsibility for Your Applications</h3>
<p>You are solely responsible for all maintenance and support for your Applications, and you will ensure that your Applications comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy, data security, advertising, and marketing laws and regulations, and with all technical and compatibility requirements provided in our documentation. We disclaim all responsibility and liability related to your Applications. You must make any use of your Applications by third parties (including without limitation other Budibase users) subject to a privacy policy and terms and conditions that comply with applicable law and that accurately and plainly describe your and our collection, use, storage, and sharing of such third parties’ personal and confidential data in connection with your Applications and our Service. For clarity, you will retain ownership of your Applications, subject to our rights in our APIs and our Service. We reserve the right to audit your Applications to determine whether they violate these Terms.</p>
<h2 id="4-charges-and-payment">4. Charges and Payment</h2>
<h3 id="41-subscription-plans">4.1 Subscription Plans</h3>
<p>We may offer plans that you can sign up for that allow you to use certain aspects of Budibase, either for free or for a fee (a &ldquo;Subscription Plan&rdquo;). We may change Subscription Plans by offering new services for additional fees and charges and adding or amending fees and charges for existing Subscription Plans in our sole discretion. Any change to a Subscription Plan’s pricing or payment terms will become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in these Terms. Subscription Plans may set allotments for use of designated Service aspects. Use of Service aspects in excess of a Subscription Plan’s designated allotment may result in (additional) fees, as specified in the plan, and such fees will be included in a true-up invoice or charged automatically via the payment method associated with your Budibase Account (&ldquo;Payment Method&rdquo;).</p>
<h3 id="42-billing-and-payment">4.2 Billing and Payment</h3>
<p>For any paid Subscription Plan, you agree to make payments, and we may automatically charge your Payment Method, as described below, for so long as your Budibase Account remains active. Subscription Plans may be offered for a set subscription period (each such period, a &ldquo;Subscription Term&rdquo;). If you elect to use a paid Subscription Plan, you agree to the pricing and payment terms specified at checkout, at Budibase.com/pricing, as otherwise posted or communicated to you, as we may update them from time to time. You must provide Budibase with a current, valid, accepted Payment Method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, you authorize us to provide your payment information to third parties so we can complete your transaction and to charge your Payment Method, in United States dollars, for the type of transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) and any applicable recurring charges as described below. You will pay applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such transaction and are also responsible for any payment-related fees such as wire transfer fees, credit card processing fees, and foreign transaction fees. We currently use Stripe as our third party service provider for payment services, and by using Budibase you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Services Agreement, available at stripe.com/us/legal. If your payment is not successfully settled for any reason, you remain responsible for any amounts not remitted to us. All payments for transactions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.</p>
<h3 id="43-renewals">4.3 Renewals</h3>
<p>Your subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of Budibase in accordance with these Terms. All Subscription Plans will automatically renew until cancelled by you for renewal terms equal in length to the original Subscription Term. If you do not want a Subscription Plan to renew, you must cancel it at least thirty (30) days before the end of the Subscription Term by providing written notice to us of such cancellation (including by email to <a href="mailto:support@Budibase.com">support@Budibase.com</a> or via your account settings page on your Budibase Account). If you purchase a Subscription Plan, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you each year on the anniversary of the commencement of your subscription, using the payment information you have provided, until you cancel your subscription. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription Plan, you acknowledge that your Subscription Plan has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your subscription by you or us.</p>
<h3 id="44-cancellations">4.4 Cancellations</h3>
<p>If we terminate your Subscription Plan, except in the event of your breach or failure to pay fees when due, we will grant you a prorated refund for the remaining unused portion of your Subscription Term. You are not entitled to a refund for any Subscription Plan that you cancel. If you cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, your right to use Budibase will continue until the end of your then-current Subscription Term and then terminate without further charges.</p>
<h3 id="45-late-payments">4.5 Late Payments</h3>
<p>Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less (plus the costs of collection).</p>
<h2 id="5-privacy">5. Privacy</h2>
<p>We care about the privacy of our users. By using Budibase you acknowledge that we may collect, use, and disclose your personal information and aggregate and/or anonymized data as set forth in our Privacy Policy, available at budibase.com/privacy, and acknowledge that you may have your personal information collected, used, transferred to and processed in the United States.

<h2 id="10-confidentiality">10. Confidentiality</h2>
<h3 id="101-confidential-information">10.1 Confidential Information</h3>
<p>From time to time, either party to these Terms (the &ldquo;Disclosing Party&rdquo;) may disclose or make available to the other (the &ldquo;Receiving Party&rdquo;) non-public, proprietary, or confidential information of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes any information that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of the Receiving Party&rsquo;s breach of this confidentiality section; (ii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information; (iii) was in the Receiving Party&rsquo;s possession prior to the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s disclosure thereof; or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.</p>
<h3 id="102-protection-and-use-of-confidential-information">10.2 Protection and Use of Confidential Information</h3>
<p>The Receiving Party shall: (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially-reasonable degree of care; (ii) only use the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information, and only permit it to be accessed or used, for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Terms, or for any other purpose consistent with the Privacy Policy; and (iii) not disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Receiving Party&rsquo;s service providers or financial/legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms.</p>
<h3 id="103-compelled-access-or-disclosure">10.3 Compelled Access or Disclosure</h3>
<p>If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure, use commercially-reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.</p>
<h3 id="104-injunctive-relief">10.4 Injunctive Relief</h3>
<p>Each of the parties to these Terms acknowledges that the other party will be irreparably harmed if Confidential Information of the other is distributed in breach of this Section, and that such other party would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of such an actual or threatened breach. Therefore, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened breaches of this Section by the other party without the necessity of showing actual damages or showing that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy.</p>
